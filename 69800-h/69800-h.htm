It was Christmas eve, and the parlors of
No. 46 Shelby Street were ablaze with
light; rare flowers, in vases rarer still,
filled the rooms with a sweet perfume,
bringing back, as it were, the summer glory which
had faded in the autumn light, and died in the chill
December’s breath. Costly pictures adorned the
walls; carpets, which seemed to the eye like a
mossy bed inlaid with roses, covered the floors,
while over all, the gas-light fell, making a scene of
brilliant beauty such as was seldom witnessed in
the quiet city of ——, where our story opens.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the night of Alice Warren’s first presentation
to society, as a young lady, and in her luxurious
dressing-room she stood before her mirror, bending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>her graceful head, while her mother placed among
her flowing curls a golden arrow, and then pronounced
the toilet complete. Alice Warren was
very beautiful with her fair young face, her waving
hair, and lustrous eyes of blue, which shone with
more than their wonted brightness, as, smoothing
down the folds of her dress, she glanced again at
the mirror opposite, and then turned toward her
mother just as a movement in the hall without attracted
the attention of both. It was a slow, uncertain
step, and darting forward, Alice cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is father—come to see how I look on my
eighteenth birthnight!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to <em>see</em> you, my child,” the father answered;
and in the tones of his voice there was a note of sorrow,
as if the struggle of nineteen long years were
not yet fully over.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Hugo Warren the world was one dark, dreary
night, and the gold so many coveted would have
been freely given, could he but once have looked
upon the face of his only child, who, bounding to
his side, parted the white hair from his forehead,
and laying his hand upon her head, asked him “to
<em>feel</em> if she were not beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very tenderly and caressingly the father’s hand
moved over the shining hair, the glowing cheek,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and rounded arms of the graceful little figure which
stood before him, then dashing a tear away, the
blind man said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Alice must be beautiful if she is, as they tell
me, like her mother,” and the sightless eyes turned
instinctively toward the mother, who, coming to his
side, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice is like me as I was when you last saw my
face—but I have changed since then—there are lines
of silver in my hair, and lines of time upon my
face.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The blind man shook his head. The picture of
the fond girl-wife, who, in his hour of bitter agony
had whispered in his ear, “I will be sunlight,
moonlight, starlight—everything to you, my husband,”
had never changed to him—for faithfully and
well that promise had been kept, and it was better
perhaps, that he could not see the shadows on her
face—shadows which foretold a darker hour than
any he had ever known—an hour when the sunlight
of her love would set forever. But no such forebodings
were around him now. He held his wife
and daughter both in his arms, and holding them
thus, forgot for a moment that he was blind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you invite Adelaide?” Alice asked at last;
and Mr. Warren replied:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Yes, but it is doubtful whether she will come.
She is very proud, her father says, and does not wish
to put herself in a position to be slighted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, father!” Alice cried, “Adelaide Huntington
does not know me. I could not slight her because
she is poor, and if she comes I will treat her
like a royal princess,” and Alice’s face flushed with
pleasure as she thought how attentive she would be
to the daughter of her father’s “confidential clerk
and authorized agent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, in a distant part of the city, in a
dwelling far more humble than that of Hugo Warren,
another family group was assembled, father, mother,
daughter—all, save old Aunt Peggy, who, thankful
for a home which saved her from the almshouse,
performed willingly a menial’s part, bearing patiently
the whims of the mother, and the caprices
of the daughter, the latter of whom proved a most tyrannical
and exacting mistress. Tall, dignified, and
rather aristocratic in her bearing, Adelaide Huntington
was called handsome by many, and admired
by those who failed to see the treachery hidden in her
large, dark eyes, or the constant effort she made to
seem what she was not. To be noticed by those
whose position in life was far above her own, was
her aim, and when the envied Alice Warren extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to her family an invitation to be present at
her birthday party, her delight was unbounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would go, of course, she said, “and her
father would go with her, and she must have a new
dress, too, even if it took every cent they had.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The dress was purchased, and though it was only
a simple white muslin, it well became the queenly
form of the haughty Adelaide, who, when her toilet
was completed, asked her father if “he did not
think she would overshadow the diminutive Alice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t see why there should be this difference
between us,” she continued, as her father made no
answer. “Here I must be poor all my life, while
she will be rich, unless Mr. Warren chances to
fail——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which he will do before three days are passed,”
dropped involuntarily from the lips of Mr. Huntington.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then with a wild, startled look he grasped his
daughter’s arm, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forget what I just said—breathe not a word of
it to any one, for Heaven knows I would help it if I
could. But it is too late—too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in vain that Adelaide and her mother
sought an explanation of these strange words. Mr.
Huntington would give none, and in unbroken silence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>he accompanied his daughter to the house of
Mr. Warren.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very cordially Alice welcomed the young girl
striving in various ways to relieve her from the embarrassment
she would naturally feel at finding herself
among so many strangers. And Adelaide <em>was</em>
ill at ease, for the spirit of jealous envy in her heart
whispered to her of slight and insult where none
were intended; whispered, too, that her muslin dress
which, at home with her mother and Aunt Peggy to
admire, had been so beautiful, was nothing, compared
with the soft, flowing robes of Alice Warren,
whose polite attentions she construed into a kind
of patronizing pity exceedingly annoying to one of
her proud nature. Then, as she remembered her
father’s words, she thought, “<em>We may be equals yet.</em>
I wonder what he meant? I mean to ask him
again,” and passing through the crowded apartments
she came to the little ante-room, where all
the evening her father had been sitting—a hard,
dark look upon his face, and his eyes bent on the
floor, as if for him that festive scene possessed no
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father,” she said, but he made her no reply;
he did not even know that she was standing at
his side.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Far back through the “past” his thoughts were
straying, to the Christmas Eve when penniless,
friendless and alone he had come to the city, asking
employment from one whose hair was not
as white then as it was now, and whose eyes were
not quenched in darkness, but looked kindly down
upon him, as the wealthy merchant said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will give you work as long as you do well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hugo Warren was older than William Huntington,
and his station in life had always been different,
but over the mountain side the same Sunday bell
had once called them both to the house of God—the
same tall tree on the river bank bore on its bark
their names—the same blue sky had bent above
their childhood’s home, and for this reason he had
given the poor young man a helping hand, aiding
him step by step, until now, he was the confidential
clerk—the one trusted above all others—for when
the blindness first came upon him the helpless man
had put his hand on William’s head, saying, as he
did so:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust <em>you</em>, with my all, and as you hope for
Heaven, do not be false to the trust.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How those words, spoken years before, rang in
William Huntington’s ears, as he sat thinking of
the past, until the great drops of perspiration gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>thickly around his lips and dropped upon the
floor. He had betrayed his trust—nay, more, he
had ruined the man who had been so kind to him,
and before three days were passed his sin would find
him out. Heavy bank notes must be paid, and
there was nothing with which to pay them. The
gambling table had been his ruin. Gradually he
had gone down, meaning always to replace what he
had taken, and oftentimes doing so; but fortune
had deserted him at last, and rather than meet the
glance of those sightless eyes, when the truth
should be known, he had resolved to go away. The
next day would be a holiday, and before the Christmas
sun set, he would be an outcast—a wanderer on
the earth. Of all this he was thinking when Adelaide
came to his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of her voice aroused him at last, and
starting up, he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is time we were at home. The atmosphere
of these rooms is stifling. Get your things at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rather unwillingly Adelaide obeyed, and ten
minutes later she was saying good night to Alice
and her mother, both of whom expressed their surprise
that she should go so soon, as did Mr. Warren
also.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant to have talked with you more,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>said, as he stood in the hall with Mr. Huntington,
who, grasping his hand, looked earnestly into the
face which for all time to come would haunt him as
the face of one whom he had greatly wronged.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few hours later, and all was still in the house
where mirth and revelry had so lately reigned.
Flushed with excitement and the flattery her youthful
beauty had called forth, Alice Warren had
sought her pillow, and in the world of dreamland
was living over again the incidents of the evening.
The blind man, too, was sleeping, and in his dreams
he saw again the forms of those he loved, but he did
not see the cloud hovering near, nor the crouching
figure which, across the way, was looking toward
his window and bidding him farewell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Huntington had accompanied Adelaide to
his door, and then, making some trivial excuse, had
left her, and gone from his home forever, leaving his
wife to watch and wait for him as she had often done
before. Slowly the December night waned, and
just as the morning was breaking—the morn of the
bright Christmas day—a train sped on its way to
the westward, bearing among its passengers one
who fled from justice, leaving to his wife and
daughter grief and shame, and to the blind man
<em>darkness, ruin, and death</em>.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The third day came and passed, and as the
twilight shadows fell upon the city, Alice
and her mother pushed back the heavy
curtain which shaded the window of their
pleasant sitting-room, and looked anxiously down
the street for one who seldom tarried long. An
hour went by, and another still, and then he came,
but far more helpless than when he left them in the
morning. The blind eyes were red with tears—the
stately form was bent with grief—the strong man
was crushed with the blow which had fallen so
suddenly upon him. He was ruined—hopelessly,
irretrievably ruined, and in all the world there was
nothing he could call his, save the loved ones who
soothed him now, as one had done before, when a
mighty sorrow overshadowed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As well as he could he told them of the fraud
which for many years had been imposed upon him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and how he had trusted and been betrayed by
one whom he would not suffer the officers to
follow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will do no good,” he said “to have him
brought back to a felon’s cell, and I will save the
wife and daughter from more disgrace,” and so
William Huntington was suffered to go at large,
while in the home he had desolated there was
sorrow and mourning and bitter tears shed; the
blind man groping often through the familiar
rooms which would soon be his no longer; and the
daughter stifling her own grief to soothe her father’s
sorrow, and minister to her mother’s wants.</p>

<p class='c011'>As has before been hinted, Mrs. Warren was far
from being strong, and the news of the failure burst
upon her with an overwhelming power, prostrating
her at once, so that before two weeks were gone
her husband forgot everything, save the prayer
that the wife of his bosom, the light of his eyes, the
mother of his child, might live.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she who had been reared in the lap of luxury,
was never to know the pinching wants of poverty—never
to know what it was to be hungry, and
cold, and poor. All this was reserved for the gentle
Alice, who, younger and stronger, too, could
bear the trial better. And so, as day after day went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>by, the blind man felt what he could not see—felt
the death shadows come creeping on—felt how the
pallor was deepening on his wife’s cheek—knew that
she was going from him fast—knew, alas, that she
must die, and one bright, beautiful morning, when
the thoughtless passers-by, pointing to the house,
said, one to another, “He has lost everything,” he,
from the depths of his aching heart, unconsciously
made answer, “Lost everything—lost everything!”
while Alice bowed her head in anguish, half
wishing she, too, were blind, so she could not
see the still, white face which lay upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly the deep stillness of the room was broken
by the sound of footsteps in the hall below,
and, lifting up her head, Alice said, “Who is it,
father?” but Mr. Warren did not answer. He knew
who it was and why they had come, and going out
to meet them, he stood upon the stairs, tall and
erect, like some giant oak which the lightning
stroke had smitten, but not destroyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know your errand,” he said; “I expected
you, but come with me and then surely you will
leave me alone a little longer,” and turning, he led
the way, followed by the men, who never forgot
that picture of the pale, dead wife, the frightened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>weeping child, and the blind man standing by with
outstretched arm as if to shield them from harm.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sheriff was a man of kindly feelings, and
lifting his hat reverentially, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We did not know of this, or we would not
have come,” and motioning to his companion, he
left the room, walking with subdued footsteps down
the stairs, and out into the open air; and when the
sun went down not an article had been disturbed in
Hugo Warren’s home, for sheriff, creditors, lawyers—all
stood back in awe of the mighty potentate who
had entered before them, and levied upon its choicest
treasure—the white-haired blind man’s wife.</p>

Nearly a year has passed by since we left
the blind man weeping over his unburied
dead, and our story leads us now to the
handsome rural town of Oakland, which
is nestled among the New England hills, and owes
much of its prosperity and rapid growth to the untiring
energy of its wealthiest citizen—its one “aristocrat,”
as the villagers persisted in calling Richard
Howland, the gentleman from Boston, who came to
Oakland a few years ago, giving to business a new
impetus, and infusing new life into its quiet, matter-of-fact
people, who respected him as few men have
ever been respected, and looked upon him as the
founder of their good fortune. He it was who built
the factory, bought the mills and owned the largest
store and shoe shop in the town, furnishing employment
to hundreds of the poor, many of whom
had moved into the village, and rented of him the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>comfortable tenements which he had erected for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Richard Howland’s home was very beautiful,
overlooking, as it did, the town and the surrounding
country, and the passers-by often stopped to admire
its winding walks, its fountains, its grassy plats,
graceful evergreens, and wealth of flowers, the latter
of which were the especial pride of the stately Miss
Elinor, the maiden sister, who was mistress of the
house, for Richard Howland had no wife, and on
the night when we first introduce him to our readers,
he was seated in his pleasant sitting-room, with
his sister at his side, and every possible comfort and
luxury around him. The chill December wind
which howled among the naked branches of the maples,
or sighed through the drooping cedar boughs,
could not find entrance there. The blinds were
closely shut—the heavy curtains swept the floor—the
fire burned brightly in the grate, casting fantastic
shadows on the wall, and with his favorite paper in
his hand, he almost forgot that in the world without
there were such evils as poverty or pain. Neither
did he see the fragile form toiling through the darkness
up the street, and pausing at his gate. But he
heard the ringing of the door-bell, and his ear caught
the sound of some one in the hall, asking to see him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“I wish I could be alone for one evening,” he
said, and with a slight frown of impatience upon
his brow, he awaited the approach of his visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a delicate young girl, and her dress of
black showed that sorrow had thus early come to
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you Mr. Howland?” she asked, and her
eyes of blue timidly sought the face of the young
man, who involuntarily arose and offered her a
seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her errand was soon told. She had come to rent
his cheapest tenement—the brown house in the hollow,
which she had heard was vacant, and she wished
him to furnish her with work—she could make
both shirts and vests tolerably well, and she would
try hard to pay the rent!</p>

<p class='c011'>The stranger paused, and Miss Elinor, who had
been watching her with mingled feelings of curiosity
and interest, saw that the  long eyelashes were
moist with tears. Mr. Howland saw it, too, and
wondering that one so young and timid should come
to him alone, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little girl, have you no friends—no one on
whom to depend, save yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The tears on the eyelashes now dropped upon
the cheek, for the <em>little girl</em>, as Mr. Howland had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>called her, mistook his meaning and fancied he was
thinking of security, and payment, and all those
dreadful words whose definition she was fast learning
to understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a father,” she said, and before she had
time for more, the plain-spoken Miss Elinor asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why didn’t he come himself, and not send you,
who seem so much a child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was reproach in the question, and the
young girl felt it keenly, and turning toward Miss
Elinor, she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father could not find the way—he never
even saw my face—he couldn’t see my mother when
she died. Oh! he’s blind, he’s blind,” and the
voice, which at first had merely trembled, was
choked with bitter sobs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hearts of both brother and sister were
touched, and the brown house in the hollow, nay,
any house which Richard Howland had to rent,
was at the girl’s command. But he was a man of
few words, and so he merely told her she could
have both tenement and work, while his sister
thought how she would make her brother’s new
tenants her especial care.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Elinor was naturally of a rather inquisitive
turn of mind and she tried very skillfully to learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>something of the stranger’s history. But the young
girl evaded all her questioning, and after a few
moments arose to go. Mr. Howland accompanied
her to the door, which he held open until she passed
down the walk and out into the street. Then the
door was closed, and Alice Warren was alone again
in the cold, dark night, but she scarcely heeded it,
for her heart was lighter than it had been for many
weeks. The gentleman whom she had so much
dreaded to meet had spoken kindly to her; the lady
too, had whispered “poor child” when she told
her of her father, while better far than all, she had
procured a shelter for her father, the payment for
which would come within their slender means.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not time, but the joy or sorrow it brings,
changes people most, and the Alice Warren of to-day
is scarce the same we saw one year ago. Then,
petted, caressed and glowing with youthful beauty,
she presented a striking contrast to the pale-faced
girl, who, on the wintry night of which we write,
traversed street after street, until she came to the
humble dwelling which for the last few days had
been her home. Every cent of his large fortune
had Mr. Warren given up, choosing rather to starve
and know he had a right to do so, than to feed on
what was not his own. His handsome house and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>furniture had all been sold, and with a mere pittance,
which would not last them long, they had gone
into the country, where Alice hoped to earn a livelihood
by teaching. But she was “too small, too
childish, too timid,” the people said, ever to succeed,
and so at last she resorted to her needle,
which in her days of prosperity, she had fortunately
learned to use.</p>

<p class='c011'>As time passed on a kind-hearted woman, who
visited in their neighborhood, became interested
in them and urged their removal to Oakland, her
native town, whither they finally went, stopping
with her for a few days until further arrangements
could be made.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing that the brown house in the hollow, as
it was called, was vacant, Alice had applied for it,
with what success we have seen, and returning home,
she told her father the result of her application,
and how small a sum they would have to pay for it,
and how neatly she could fit it up, and how in the
long winter evenings he should sit in his arm-chair
before the cheerful fire, and listening to her as she
talked, the blind man thanked God that the wife-love
he had lost forever was in a measure made up to
him in the love of his only child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two weeks went by, and then, in the shoe shop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and store the workmen said to each other, “to-morrow
is Christmas,” wondering if Mr. Howland
would present each of the families in his employ
with a turkey, as he was wont to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had always done it before, they said, he
would surely do so now.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor were they disappointed, for when the day’s
labor was over, each man was given his usual gift,
and when all had been served, there was one turkey
left, for which no owner came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall need it ourselves perhaps,” Mr. Howland
thought, as he remembered the numerous city
friends expected on the morrow; and, as he was not
ashamed to carry it himself, he placed it in a covered
basked and started for home, turning involuntarily
down the street which would take him
through the hollow. He did not often go that way
for though it was quite as near, it was not a pleasant
portion of the town. But he was going that
way now, and as he came near the brown house,
from whose windows a cheerful light was shining,
he thought of his new tenants, and half decided to
call; then, remembering that one of his clerks had
told him of a young lady who had inquired for
him that afternoon, expressing much regret at his
absence and saying she should call at his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>house early in the evening, he concluded to go
on. Still the light shining out upon the snow,
seemed beckoning him to come, and turning back
he stood before the window, from which the curtain
was drawn aside, revealing a picture, at which
he paused a moment to gaze. The blind man sat
in his old arm-chair, and the flickering flame of the
blazing fire shone on his frosty locks and lighted
up his grief-worn face, on which there was a pitiful
expression, most touching to behold. The sightless
eyes were cast downward as if they would see
the fair young head and wealth of soft brown
tresses resting on his knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was crying. All day long she had
tried to repress her tears, and when, as she sat in
the gathering twilight with her father, he said, “<em>She</em>
was with us one year ago,” they burst forth, and
laying her head upon his lap she sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were words of love spoken of the lost
one, and as Mr. Howland drew near, Mr. Warren
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is well, perhaps, that she died before she
knew what it was to be so poor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words “to be so poor” caught Mr. Howland’s
ear, and glancing around the humble apartment
he fancied he knew why Alice wept. Just then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>she lifted up her head and he saw the tears on her
cheek. Mr. Howland was unused to tears—they
affected him strangely—and as the sight of them on
Alice Warren’s eyelashes, when she told him her
father was blind, had once brought down the rent
of the house by half, so now the sight of them upon
her cheek as she sat at her father’s feet brought
himself into her presence and the turkey from his
basket. Depositing his gift upon the table and
apologizing for his abruptness, he took the chair
which Alice offered him, and in a short space of
time forgot the young lady who had so nearly
prevented him from being where he was—forgot
everything save the blue of Alice’s eyes and the
mournful sweetness of her voice as she answered
the few questions he addressed to her. He
saw at once that both father and daughter were educated
and refined, but he did not question them of
the past, for he felt instinctively that it would be to
them an unpleasant subject, so he conversed upon
indifferent topics, and Alice, as she listened to him,
could scarcely believe he was the man whom she
had heretofore associated with her wages of Saturday
night, he seemed so familiar and friendly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will come to see us again,” Mr. Warren
said to his visitor, when the latter arose to go, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>smiling down on Alice, who stood with her arm
across her father’s neck, Mr. Howland answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I shall come again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he bade them good night, and as the door
closed after him, Mr. Warren said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems darker now that he is gone,” but to
Alice, the room was lighter far for that brief visit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Howland, too, felt better for the call. He
had done some good, he hoped, and the picture of
the two as he had left them was pleasant to remember,
and as he drew near his home, and saw in
imagination his own large easy-chair before the
fire, he tried to fancy how it would seem to be a
blind man, sitting there, with a brown-haired maiden’s
arm around his neck.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_032.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“Miss Huntington, brother,” Miss Elinor
said, and Mr. Howland bowed low to
the lady thus presented to him by his
sister on his arrival home.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been waiting for him nearly an hour,
and she now returned his greeting with an air more
befitting a queen than Adelaide Huntington—for
she it was; and by some singular co-incidence she
had come to rent a house of Mr. Howland just as
Alice Warren had done but two or three weeks before.
The failure which had ruined Mr. Warren had
not affected Mrs. Huntington further than the mortification
and grief she naturally felt at the disgrace
and desertion of her husband, from whom she had
never heard since he left her so suddenly on the
night of the party—neither had she ever met with
Mr. Warren, although she had written him a note,
assuring him that in no way had she been concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>in the fraud. Still her position in the city
was not particularly agreeable, and after a time she
had removed to Springfield, Mass., where she took
in plain sewing—for without her husband’s salary
it was necessary that she should do something for the
maintenance of her family. Springfield, however,
was quite too large for one of Adelaide’s proud, ambitious
nature. “She would rather live in a smaller
place,” she said, “where she could be <em>somebody</em>.
She had been trampled down long enough, and in
a country village she would be as good as any
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing by chance of Oakland and its democratic
people, she had persuaded her mother into
removing thither, giving her numerous directions
as to the manner in which she was to demean herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With a little management,” she said, “no one
need to know that we have <em>worked</em> for a living—we
have only left the city because we prefer the
country,” and old Peggy, who still served in the
capacity of servant, was charged repeatedly “never
to say a word concerning their former position in
society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In short, Adelaide intended to create quite a
sensation in Oakland, and she commenced by assuming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>a most haughty and consequential manner
toward both Mr. Howland and his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had come as <em>ma’s</em> delegate,” she said, to
rent the white house on the hill, which they had
heard was vacant. Possibly if they liked the country,
they should eventually purchase, but it was
doubtful—people who have always lived a city life
were seldom contented elsewhere. Still, she should
try to be happy, though of course she should miss
the advantages which a larger place afforded.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this and much more she said to Mr. Howland,
who, hardly knowing whether she were renting
a house of him or he were renting one of her,
managed at last to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your mother is a widow, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Instantly the dark eyes sought the floor, and
Adelaide’s voice was very low in its tone as she
answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I lost my father nearly a year since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder she don’t dress in mourning, but
that’s a way some folks have,” Miss Elinor thought,
while her brother proceeded to say that Mrs. Huntington
could have the white house on the hill, after
which Adelaide arose to go, casually asking if the
right or left hand street would bring her to the
hotel, where she was obliged to spend the night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>as no train, after that hour, went up to Springfield.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Mr. Howland waited, thinking
his sister would invite the stranger to stop with
them, but this Miss Elinor had no idea of doing;
she did not fancy the young lady’s airs, and she simply
answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The right hand street—you can’t mistake it;”
frowning slightly when her brother said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will accompany you, Miss Huntington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dislike very much to trouble you. Still I
hardly know the way alone,” and Adelaide’s dark
eyes flashed brightly upon him as she accepted his
offer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Howland was not a lady’s man, but he could
be very agreeable when he tried, and so Adelaide
now found him, mentally resolving to give her
mother and old Aunt Peggy a double charge not to
betray their real circumstances. Mr. Howland evidently
thought her a person of consequence, and
who could tell what might come of her acquaintance
with him? Stranger things had happened, and she
thought that if she ever should go to that handsome
house as its mistress, her first act would be to send
that stiff old maid away.</p>

<p class='c011'>With such fancies as these filling her mind, Adelaide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>went back next day to Springfield, reported
her success, and so accelerated her mother’s movements
that scarcely a week elapsed ere they had
moved into the white house on the hill, a handsome
little cottage, which looked still more cozy and inviting
after Adelaide’s hands had fitted it up with
tasteful care. It was a rule with Mrs. Huntington
to buy the best, if possible, and as her husband had
always been lavish with his money, her furniture
was superior to that of her neighbors, many of
whom really stood in awe of the genteel widow, as
she was thought to be, and her stylish, aristocratic
daughter. They were supposed to be quite wealthy,
or at least in very easy circumstances, and more
than one young girl looked enviously at Adelaide,
as day after day she swept through the streets,
sometimes “walking for exercise,” she said, and
again going out to shop; always at Mr. Howland’s
store, where she annoyed the clerks excessively by
examining article after article, inquiring its price,
wondering if it would become her, or suit ma, and
finally concluding not to take it “for fear every
shoemaker’s daughter in town would buy something
like it, and that she couldn’t endure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Regularly each week she went to Springfield,
to take music lessons, she said, and lest something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>should occur making it necessary for her to stay all
night, Aunt Peggy usually accompanied her to the
depot, always carrying a well-filled satchel, and
frequently a large bundle, whose many wrappings
of paper told no tales, and were supposed by the
credulous to cover the dressing-gown, which Adelaide
deemed necessary to the making of her morning
toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was very annoying,” she said, “to carry so
much luggage, but the friends with whom she
stopped were so particular that she felt obliged to
change her dress, even though she merely stayed to
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the villagers, looking at the roll of
music she invariably carried in her hands, believed
the tale, though a few of the nearest neighbors
wondered when the young lady practiced, for it was
not often that they heard the sound of the old-fashioned
instrument which occupied a corner of
the sitting-room. Finally, however, they decided
that it must be at night, for a light was
always seen in Mrs. Huntington’s windows until
after the clock struck twelve. As weeks went by,
most of those whom Adelaide considered <em>somebodies</em>,
called, and among them Mr. Howland. By the
merest chance she learned that he was coming and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>though she pretended that she was surprised to see
him, and said she was just going out, she was
most becomingly dressed in her nicely-fitting
merino, which, in the evening, did not show the
wear of four years. The little sitting-room, too,
with its furniture so arranged as to make the best
of everything, seemed homelike and cheerful, causing
Mr. Howland to feel very much at ease, and
also very much pleased with the dark-eyed girl he
had come to see. She was very agreeable, he
thought, much more so in fact than any one he had
met in Oakland, and at a late hour, for one of
his early habits, he bade her good night, promising
to call again soon, and hear the new song she
was going to learn the next time she went to
Springfield.</p>

<p class='c011'>In dignified silence his sister awaited his return,
and when to her greeting, “Where have you been?”
he replied, “Been to call on Miss Adelaide,” the
depth of the three winkles between her eyebrows
was perceptibly increased, while a contemptuous
Pshaw! escaped her lips. Miss Elinor was not
easily deceived. From the first she had insisted
that Adelaide “was putting on airs,” and if there
was one thing more than another which that
straightforward, matter-of-fact lady disliked, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>pretention. She had not yet been to see Mrs.
Huntington, and now, when her brother, after
dwelling at length upon the pleasant evening he
had spent, urged her to make the lady’s acquaintance,
she replied rather sharply, that she always
wished to know something of the people with
whom she associated. For her part, she didn’t like
Miss Adelaide, and if her brother had the least
regard for her feelings, he wouldn’t call there quite
as often as he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite as often,” Mr. Howland repeated, in
much surprise. “What do you mean? I’ve only
been there once,” and then in a spirit which men
will sometimes manifest when opposed, particularly
if in that opposition a lady is involved, he added,
“but I intend to go again—and very soon, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Undoubtedly,” was his sister’s answer, and
taking a light, the indignant woman walked from
the room, thinking to herself that, if ever <em>that</em>
girl came there to live—she’d no idea she would—but
if she did, she—Miss Elinor Howland would
make the house a little too uncomfortable for them</p>

The next morning Miss Elinor felt better,
and as time passed on and her brother
did not again visit his new tenants, she
began to feel a little more amiably disposed toward
the strangers, and at last decided to call, intending
to go next to the brown house in the hollow, where
she was a frequent visitor. She accordingly started
one afternoon for the white house on the hill, where
she was most cordially received. With the ladylike
manners of Mrs. Huntington she could find no
fault, but she did not like the expression of Adelaide’s
eyes, nor the sneering manner in which she
spoke of the country and country people; neither
did she fail to see the basket which the young lady
pushed hastily under the lounge as Aunt Peggy ushered
her into the sitting-room. On the table there
were scissors, needles and thread, but not a vestige
of sewing was visible, though on the carpet were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>shreds of cloth, and from beneath the lounge peeped
something which looked vastly like the wristband
of a man’s shirt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pride and poverty! I’ll venture to say they
sew for a living,” Miss Elinor thought, and making
her call as brief as possible, she arose to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in vain that Adelaide urged her to stay
longer, telling her “it was such a treat to see some
one who seemed like their former acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With a toss of her head Miss Elinor declined,
saying she was going to visit a poor family in the
hollow, a blind man and his daughter, and in adjusting
her furs she failed to see how both Adelaide
and her mother started at her words. Soon recovering
her composure, the former asked, who they
were, and if they had always lived in Oakland?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their name is Warren,” said Miss Elinor,
“and they came, I believe, from some city in western
New York, but I know nothing definite concerning
them, as they always shrink from speaking
of their former condition. Alice, though, is a sweet
little creature—so kind to her old father, and so refined,
withal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mechanically bidding her visitor good afternoon,
Adelaide went to her mother’s side, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Who thought those Warrens would toss up in
Oakland! Of course, when they know that we are
here, they’ll tell all about father and everything
else. What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are not to blame for your father’s misdeeds,”
Mrs. Huntington answered; and Adelaide
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it, but people think you are a widow
with a competence sufficient to support us genteelly—they
don’t suspect how late we sit up nights, sewing,
to make ends meet. Mercy! I hope the peeking
old maid didn’t see that,” she exclaimed, as her
own eye fell upon the wristband. Then, after a
moment, she continued, “I know what I’ll do. I’ll
go to Alice this very night, and tell her how sorry
we are for what has happened, and I’ll ask her to
say nothing about father’s having cheated them and
run away. She’s a pretty good sort of a girl, I
guess, if I did once to think her so proud.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The plan seemed a feasible one, and that evening
as Alice Warren sat bending over a vest, which she
must finish that night, she was startled by the
abrupt entrance of Adelaide Huntington, who, seizing
both her hands, said, with well-feigned distress:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My poor Alice! I never expected to find you
thus.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>In his arm-chair Mr. Warren was sleeping, but
when the stranger’s shadow fell upon him, he
awoke, and stretching out his arms, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is it, Alice?—who stands between me and
the fire?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is I,” answered Adelaide, coming to his side,
“the daughter of him who ruined you. I have just
learned that you were living here in the same village
with ourselves, and, at my mother’s request, I have
come to tell you how bitterly we have wept over my
father’s sin, and to ask you not to hate us for a deed
of which we knew nothing until it was all over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then seating herself in a chair she continued
to speak hurriedly, telling them some truth and
some falsehood—telling them how, for a few months
they had lived with a distant relative, a wealthy
man, who gave them money now for their support—telling
them how her father’s disgrace had affected
her mother, and begging of them not to speak of
it in Oakland, where it was not known.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know why it is,” she said, “but people
have the impression that mother is a widow; and
though it is wrong to deceive them, I cannot tell
them my father ran away to escape a convict’s cell.
It would kill my mother outright, and if you will
keep silent, we shall be forever grateful.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>There was no reason why Mr. Warren should
speak of his former clerk, and he answered Adelaide
that neither himself nor Alice had any wish to injure
her by talking of the past. Thus relieved of
her fears, Adelaide grew very amiable and sympathetic,
saying she did not suppose they were so
poor, and pitying Alice, who must miss so much
her pictures, her flowers, her birds and her music.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come up and try my piano. You may practice
on it any time,” she said, when at last she arose to
go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never played much. I was not fond of it,”
was Alice’s answer, while her father rejoined quickly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you keep a piano. I did not know you
had one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, father bought it for me at auction,
three years ago, and as he was not owing any one
then, our furniture was not disturbed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The blind man sighed, while Alice dropped a
tear on the vest she was making, as she thought of
the difference between herself and Adelaide, who
paused as she reached the door, and asked if she
knew Mr. Howland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sew for his store,” said Alice, and Adelaide
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“Isn’t he a splendid man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice did not know whether he was splendid or
not—she had never observed his looks particularly,
she said; but she knew he was very kind, and
she liked nothing better than to have him come
there evenings, as he often did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come here often!” exclaimed Adelaide, her
voice indicating the pang with which a feeling of
jealousy had been brought to life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Alice could reply there was a footstep
outside, and the blind man, whose quick ear
caught the sound, said joyfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s coming now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had gone home before,” was the first
thought of Adelaide, who did not care to be seen
there by Mr. Howland. It might lead to some inquiries
which she would rather should not be made.
Still, there was now no escape, and trusting much
to the promise of the Warrens, she stepped back
from the door just as Mr. Howland opened it. He
seemed greatly surprised at finding her there, and
still more surprised when he learned that they were
old acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is kind in her not to desert them in their
poverty,” he thought, and his manner was still
more considerate toward Adelaide, who, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>standing a few moments, made another attempt
to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait, Miss Huntington,” said he. “It was
both raining and snowing when I came in, and you
will need an umbrella.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was just what Adelaide wanted, and taking
a seat she waited patiently until Mr. Howland
signified his readiness to go. Then, bidding Alice
good night, she whispered to her softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You never will say a word of father, will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly not,” was Alice’s reply, and in
another moment Adelaide was in the street walking
arm in arm with Mr. Howland, who began to speak
of the Warrens and their extreme poverty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is evident they have seen better days,” he
said, “but they never seem willing to speak of the
past. Did he meet with a reverse of fortune?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Adelaide was silent, while she revolved
the propriety of saying what she finally did
say, and which was—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye-es—they met with reverses, but as they are
unwilling to talk about it, I, too, had better say
nothing of a matter which cannot now be helped.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not, if it would be to their detriment,”
said Mr. Howland, a painful suspicion
entering his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Hitherto he had regarded Mr. Warren as the soul
of integrity, but Adelaide’s manner, even more than
her words, implied that there was something wrong,
and hardly knowing what he said, he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it anything dishonorable?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, I would rather say nothing about
it,” answered Adelaide. “I don’t wish to do them
harm, and I dare say they regret it more than any
one else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mentally pronouncing her a very prudent, considerate
girl, Mr. Howland walked on in silence,
feeling the while that something had been taken
from him. He had become greatly interested in the
helpless old blind man, and in his writing-desk at
home was a receipt in full for the first quarter’s rent,
which would become due in a few days. But Mr.
Howland was a man of stern integrity, hating anything
like fraud and deceit, and if Mr. Warren had
been guilty of either, he was not worthy of respect.
Alice, too, though she might not have been in fault,
did not seem quite the same, and now as he thought
of her, there was less of beauty in the deep blue of
her eyes and the wavy tresses of her hair.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>“Will you go in? It is a long time since you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>were here,” said Adelaide, when at last they reached
her mother’s door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her invitation was accepted, and the clock
struck nine before Mr. Howland rose to leave.
Accompanying him to the door, Adelaide said,
jingly:<a id='t48'></a></p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust you will forget our conversation concerning
those Warrens. You know I didn’t really
tell you anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Howland bowed and walked away, wishing
in his heart that she had <em>not</em> told him anything, or
at least had not created in his mind a suspicion
against people he had hitherto liked so much. So
absorbed was he in his meditations that he did not
at first observe the slender figure which, wrapping
its thin shawl close around it, came slowly toward
him, but when the girl reached him and the
cold wind blew the brown curls over her white
face, he knew it was Alice Warren, and his first
impulse was to offer her his arm and shield her from
the storm. But Adelaide’s dark insinuations were
ringing in his ears, and so Alice went on alone,
while the rain and the sleet beat upon her head and
the cold penetrated through her half worn shoes,
chilling her weary feet, and sending a shiver through
her frame. But she did not heed it, or even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>think of the driving storm, so eager was she to be
at home, where she could count the contents of the
little box and see if with the money received there
was not enough to pay the quarter’s rent.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the blind man, listening to the storm, knew
how cold his darling would be, and groping in the
darkness, he added fresh fuel to the fire, and then
swept up the hearth, placing her chair a little
nearer to his own, so that it would seem pleasant to
her when she came. Poor, helpless man! He could
not see—nay, he had never seen his child, but he
could fancy just how bright and beautiful she would
look sitting at his side, with the fire he had made
shining on her hair, and when at last she came, he
clasped her little red hands between his own, rubbing,
kissing, and pitying them until he felt that they
were warm. Then, seated in his chair, he listened
while she counted the silver coin, dropping it piece
by piece into his palm and bidding him guess its
value by its size. It was all counted at last, and
very joyfully Alice said to her father:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is enough to pay our rent, and we have
been comfortable, too, thanks to Miss Elinor, who
has saved us many a shilling by her timely acts of
charity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Elinor had been to them a ministering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>angel, and however much she might be disliked at
the white house on the hill, she was loved and
honored at the brown house in the hollow, and that
night when Alice Warren sought her pillow, she
breathed a prayer for the kind woman who was to
befriend her in more ways than one.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Miss Elinor sat alone in her pleasant
parlor, bending over her bit of embroidery,
and setting her needle into the
dainty fabric in a manner plainly indicating
a mind ill at ease. And for a lady of her
temperament, Miss Elinor was a good deal disturbed.
During the past week her brother had
spent four evenings at the white house on the
hill, and though she had unreservedly given him
her opinion of the young lady Adelaide, he persisted
in saying she was the most agreeable and
intelligent girl in Oakland. It was in vain that she
told him of the wristband, saying she had no doubt
they sewed secretly for a living.</p>

<p class='c011'>He only smiled incredulously, telling her, however,
that he should like Adelaide all the better if
he found she was skillful in shirt-making.</p>

<p class='c011'>In short, Miss Elinor began to have some wellfounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>fears that she should yet have an opportunity
of making the house uncomfortable, both to
herself and the wife her brother might bring there
and it was this reflection which made her so nervous,
that pleasant March afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would rather he married little Alice Warren—blind
father and all,” she thought, just as the
door opened softly, and “little Alice Warren”
stood within the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been to the store to see Mr. Howland,
she said, and as he was not there she had
come to the house, hoping to find him, for she
would rather give the money into his hand and
know there was no mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What money, child?” asked Miss Elinor, and
Alice replied that “it was pay-day,” at the same
time opening the little box and showing the pieces
of money she had saved from her earnings.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Elinor did not know of the receipt lying
in her brother’s writing-desk, but she resolved that
not a penny should be taken from that box, and
bidding Alice be seated on a little stool at her feet,
she told her to wait until her brother came. Then
when she saw how languid and tired Alice seemed,
she put her head upon her lap, smoothing the long
brown curls until the weary girl fell asleep, dreaming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>that it was her mother’s hand which thus so
tenderly caressed her hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>For half an hour she slumbered on, and then
Mr. Howland came, treading carefully and speaking
low, as his sister, pointing to the sleeping girl,
bade him not to wake her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at her, though. Isn’t she pretty?” she
whispered, and Mr. Howland, gazing upon the
fair, childish face, felt that he had seldom seen a
more beautiful picture.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few words Miss Elinor told why she was
there, adding, in conclusion:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you won’t take it, of course. You are rich
enough without it, and it will do them so much
good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never intended to take it,” Mr. Howland
replied, and going to his library, he soon returned
with the receipt, which he laid within the box.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then a new idea presented itself to the mind
of Miss Elinor. They would change the silver, she
said, into a bill, which they could roll up with the
receipt and put in Alice’s pocket while she slept.
This plan met with her brother’s approval, and
when at last Alice awoke, the box was empty, while
Mr. Howland, to whom she told her errand, blushing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>deeply to think he had found her sleeping,
replied indifferently:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I found it there, and I like your promptness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment Miss Elinor left the room, and
when she returned, she bore a basket of delicacies
for the blind man, who, even then, was standing in
the open door at home and listening anxiously for
the footsteps which did not often linger so long.
He heard them at last, and though they were far
down the street, he knew they were Alice’s, and closing
the door he passed his hands carefully over the
tea-table, which he himself had arranged, feeling
almost a childish joy as he thought how surprised
Alice would be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, father!” she exclaimed, when at last she
came bounding in, “how could you fix it so nicely?
and only think, Miss Elinor has sent you so many
good things—here’s turkey, and cranberry sauce,
and pie, and cheese, and jelly-cake, and white sugar—and
everything. I mean, for once, to eat just as
much as I want,” and the delighted girl arranged
the tempting viands upon the table, telling her
father, the while, how pleased Mr. Howland was at
her promptness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“He gave you a receipt, I suppose?” Mr.
Warren said, and Alice replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no, I never thought of a receipt. I’m so
sorry,” and in her confusion she hit her hand
against the hissing teapot she had just placed upon
the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>The slight burn which she received, made her
handkerchief necessary, and, in feeling for it, she
touched the little roll which Miss Elinor had put in
her pocket. Drawing it forth, and examining its
contents, she experienced, for an instant, sensations
similar to those which Benjamin’s brothers may be
supposed to have felt when the silver cup was found
in their possession.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does it mean?” she exclaimed, reading
aloud the receipt and examining the bill, which
amounted exactly to the quarter’s rent.</p>

<p class='c011'>The blind man knew what it meant, and, bowing
his white head upon his bosom, he silently thanked
God who had raised them up friends in their sore
need. Upon Alice the surprise produced a novel
effect, moving her first to laughter and then to tears,
and, notwithstanding her intention of “eating as
much as she liked,” she forgot to taste many of the
delicacies spread out so temptingly before her. In
her estimation they were almost rich again, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>never, perhaps, came sleep to her more sweetly than
on that night, when she knew that the contents of
the little box was theirs to do with as they pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several evenings after this they were surprised
by a call from Mr. Howland, who had not visited
them before since the night he had found Adelaide
Huntington there. Thoughts of Alice, however, as
she lay sleeping on his sister’s lap, had haunted him.
She was innocent of wrong, he was sure, and he
had come to see her. It was hard, too, to believe
there was aught of evil in that old man with the
snow white hair and truthful looking face, and, after
receiving their thanks for his generosity, he resolved
to question them a little of the past, so he
commenced by asking Alice if she had been intimately
acquainted with Adelaide Huntington.</p>

<p class='c011'>Remembering her promise, Alice seemed much
embarrassed, and answered hastily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were never intimate,” while at the same
time she glanced toward her father, whose voice
trembled slightly as he rejoined:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had business transactions with Adelaide’s
father, but our families seldom met.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment he was talking of something
else—his manner plainly indicating that any further
allusion to the Huntingtons was not desired.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“There is something wrong, or they would not
be so unwilling to talk of their former life,” Mr.
Howland thought, and, with his suspicions strengthened,
he soon took his leave, stopping by the way
to call on Adelaide, whose eyes beamed a joyous
welcome as he entered the parlor, in which she
received his frequent calls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mother was in the way in the sitting-room,
she thought, and whenever she had reason for expecting
him, she made a fire in the parlor, shutting
up the stove and turning down the lamp until the
ringing of the bell announced his arrival; then,
while old Peggy hobbled to the door, she opened
the draught and turned up the lamp, so that by the
time Mr. Howland was ushered in, everything
looked cheerful and inviting. By this means, too,
she escaped another annoyance, that of being urged
to play; for, if Mr. Howland did not see the piano,
he was not as likely to ask her to sing, and she had
already nearly exhausted her powers of invention
in excuses for her indifferent playing and the style
of her music.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ma insisted upon her taking old pieces, she
said, but by and by, when she had a new piano,
she should do differently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for her, Mr. Howland was not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>musical man and was thus more easily deceived.
On the evening of which we are speaking, after
listening a while to her sprightly remarks, he suddenly
changed the conversation by saying he had
been to see Mr. Warren.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he told me,” said he, “that he once did
business with your father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning her face away to hide its startled expression,
Adelaide asked hastily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What else did he tell you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” returned Mr. Howland. “He
would not talk of the past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should not suppose he would,” quietly rejoined
Adelaide—then, after a moment, coming to
his side, she continued, “Mr. Howland, I wish you
would promise never to mention that subject again,
either to me or those Warrens. It can do no good,
and a knowledge of the truth might injure some
people in your estimation. Promise me, will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her hand was laid imploringly upon his arm,
her handsome, dark eyes looked beseechingly into
his, and as most men under similar circumstances
would have done, he promised, while Adelaide
mentally congratulated herself upon the fact that
his business never took him to the city where she
had formerly lived, and where the name of Huntington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>had scarcely yet ceased to be a by-word in
the street. Mr. Howland was much pleased with
her, she knew, and if they could manage to keep up
appearances a little longer, he might be secured.
One thing, however, troubled her. Pay-day was
near at hand, but alas for the wherewithal to pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not in her mother’s purse, nor yet in any
other purse whence they could procure it. Still
Adelaide trusted much to her inventive genius, and
when she bade Mr. Howland good night, chatting
gayly as she accompanied him to the door, he little
dreamed how her mind was distracted with ways
and means by which to dupe him still more effectually.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Three weeks passed away, and then, as Miss Elinor
sat one evening with her brother, she asked him
if Mrs. Huntington’s rent were not that day due.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly, though I have not given it a thought,”
Mr. Howland answered, his voice indicating that he
neither deemed it essential for himself to be particular,
or his sister to be troubled, about Mrs. Huntington’s
rent.</p>

<p class='c011'>As far as dollars and cents were concerned, Miss
Elinor was not troubled, though she did think it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>doubtful whether Adelaide would be as prompt as
Alice had been. But when, as if to verify a proverb
not necessary to be repeated here, Adelaide came to
the door almost before her brother had ceased speaking,
she began to think her suspicions groundless,
and her manner was quite conciliatory toward the
young lady, who, after throwing back her veil of
dotted lace and fidgeting a while in her chair, managed
to say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very humiliating to me, Mr. Howland, to
tell you what ma says I must. She fully expected
that the agent who does her business would have
sent her money ere this, but as he has not, she cannot
pay you to-day. Shall we pack up our things
at once?” she continued, playfully, as she saw the
expression on Mr. Howland’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you had better,” he answered in the
same strain, continuing in a more sober tone.
“Tell your mother not to be concerned about the
rent. It does not matter if it is not paid until the
end of the year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adelaide drew a relieved breath, while Miss Elinor
dropped her embroidery and involuntarily gave
vent to a contemptuous “Umph!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound caught Adelaide’s ear, and thinking
to herself, “Stingy old thing—afraid they will lose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>it, I dare say,” she made her call as brief as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nodding to her civily as she arose to go, Miss
Elinor turned to her brother, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know, Richard, you are to go with me to-night
to call on Jenny Hayes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Richard did not know it, and as his distressed
sister saw him going down the walk with
Adelaide Huntington on his arm, she muttered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to see the man who could make such a
fool of me as that girl has made of him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A wish not likely to be verified, considering that
she had already lived forty-five years without seeing
the man.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Very rapidly the spring passed away, and
the soft, sunny skies of June had more
than once tempted the blind man and
his daughter into the open fields, or the
woods which lay beyond. Their favorite resort,
however, was a retired spot on the bank of the
river, where, shut out from human eyes, they could
speak together of the past, the present, and what
the future might bring. Here, one pleasant afternoon,
they came, and while Mr. Warren talked of
his childhood and his early home, Alice sat sewing
at his feet, until growing somewhat weary, she arose
and began to search for wild flowers upon the
mossy bank. Suddenly espying some beautiful
pond lilies floating upon the surface of the water,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, father, father, these must be white lilies
just like those you used to gather when a boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Where, where?” the blind man asked, and his
face shone with the intense longing he felt to hold
once more within his hand the fair blossoms so interwoven
with memories of his boyhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are here on the river,” Alice replied,
“and I can get them, too, by going out upon that
tree which has partly fallen into the stream.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, Alice—don’t! There may be danger,”
Mr. Warren said, shuddering even while he spoke
with an undefinable fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alice was not afraid, and springing lightly
upon the trunk of the tree she ventured out—farther,
and farther still, until the lilies were just
within her reach, when, alas, the branch against
which she leaned was broken, and to the ear of the
blind man sitting on the grass there came the startling
cry of “Father!” while a heavy splash in the
deep, dark water, told that Alice was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>In wild agony the distracted man ran to the
water’s edge and unhesitatingly waded in, shrieking,
as he did so:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child! my child! Is there no eye to pity,
no arm to save?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, there was an eye to pity, and it raised up an
arm to save; for, rushing from a clump of alders
which grew not far away, there came a rough, hard-featured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>man, who, catching up Mr. Warren as if
he had been a child, bore him back to the grassy
bank, then boldly plunging into the river, he seized
the long tresses of the drowning girl, just as they
were disappearing for the third and last time.
Wringing the water from her brown hair, the
stranger folded his light burden gently to his
bosom, and bending over her still, white face,
looked earnestly to see if she were dead. There
was yet life, he hoped, and swimming to the shore,
he laid the unconscious maiden upon the grass,
resting her head in the lap of her father, who cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she dead—oh, tell me, is she dead!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the stranger made him no reply, save to
take his hand and lay it on the little heart which
was beating faintly. Then with rapid footsteps he
walked away, half pausing once as he heard the
poor old man call after him imploringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t leave me all alone, for I am blind, and
Alice’s heart will stop beating, I’m afraid. It has
stopped beating! She’s dead! oh, she’s dead!” he
screamed, as in the distance he heard the tramping
footsteps going from him fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still though he knew it not, they went for him,
and Mr. Howland, whom chance had led that way,
was surprised in his walk by the sudden appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of a man with uncovered head and dripping garments,
who bade him hasten to the river bank,
where a young girl, he feared, was drowned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going for a physician,” he said, and he
sped away, while Mr. Howland hurried on to the
spot where Alice still lay insensible, and whiter
than the lilies for which she had risked her life.
Over her bent the poor old man, his tears falling
like rain upon her face, and himself whispering
sadly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s darker now than midnight—they are all
gone from me—wife, daughter, all; oh, Alice, Alice,
my bright, my beautiful one. Why did God take
you from me when I needed you so much?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She may not be dead,” said Mr. Howland, and
touched with the grief of the stricken man, his own
tears dropped on Alice’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they did not rouse her, and with a terrible
fear at his heart, he lifted her lightly in his arms,
saying to her father:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My house is nearer than any other—we must
go there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dizzy and faint with excitement, Mr. Warren
arose to his feet, but to walk was impossible, and
sinking back upon the grass, he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Leave me here and care for her. You can send
for me by and by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This seemed the only alternative, and Mr. Howland
started for home, meeting ere long with several of
the villagers who had been alarmed by the stranger.
A few of them kept on to the river, while others accompanied
Mr. Howland to the house, where crowds
of people were soon assembled, and where every
possible means were used for Alice’s recovery. But
they seemed in vain, and when at last the poor old
father reached the door he knew by the death-like
silence pervading the room, that the physician had
said, “no hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lead me to her, somebody—lead me to Alice,”
he whispered, and taking his outstretched arm, Mr.
Howland led him to the couch where Alice lay, her
wavy hair clinging in damp masses to her forehead,
and her long eyelashes resting upon her marble
cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quickly the trembling fingers sought the heart,
but alas! they felt no motion, and more than one
turned away to weep as they saw the look of bitter
anguish settling down upon the father’s face.
There was yet one test more, and laying his ear
upon the bosom of his child, the blind man listened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>intently, while the lookers-on held their breath in
agonizing suspense.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly through the room there rang the wild,
glad cry, “I hear it—she lives, she lives!” and with
renewed courage the people returned to their labor,
which this time was successful, for she who had been
so near to death, came slowly back to life, and when
the sun went down, its last parting rays shone on
the bowed head of one who from his inmost soul was
thanking God for not having written him “childless.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thought advisable that Alice should remain
where she was for a day or two, and they
carried her into a large, pleasant chamber, overlooking
the town, Miss Elinor constituting herself the
nurse, and ever and anon bending down to kiss
the lips of the young girl who had so narrowly
escaped a watery grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, in the parlors below, both Mr. Warren
and Mr. Howland were making inquiries for
the stranger, who, after giving the alarm, had suddenly
disappeared. No one had seen him since, and
of those who had seen him before, none knew who
he was or whence he came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could have heard the sound of his voice, I
should know him anywhere,” said Mr. Warren,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>while Adelaide Huntington, who had not been there
long, and who, for some reason, did not like to hear
much of the stranger, suggested that it might have
been some foot traveler, who, not caring for thanks,
had gone on his way.</p>

<p class='c011'>This seemed probable and satisfactory to all,
save Mr. Warren, who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he would come back, I’ve nothing in the
wide world to offer him; but an old man’s blessing
might be of some avail, and that he should have,
even though he were my bitterest enemy, and had
done me terrible wrong.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a deep flush on Adelaide’s cheek as
Mr. Warren said these words, and turning quickly
away, she walked to the window to hide the emotions
which she knew were plainly visible upon her
face. She seemed greatly excited, and far more interested
in the accident than her slight friendship
for the Warrens would warrant, and when she
learned that Alice was to remain, she, too, insisted
upon staying all night, provided she could be of
any assistance. But Miss Elinor declined her offer,
and at a late hour she started for home, managing
to steal away when Mr. Howland did not see her.
She evidently did not wish to have him accompany
her, and for a few succeeding days she avoided him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>going to his house but once, and that on the morning
when Alice was taken home in the carriage.
There was something preying upon her mind—something,
too, whose nature neither Mr. Howland
nor his far-seeing sister could divine, though the
former fancied he had discovered it, when, a little
more than a week after the accident, she came to
him with her face all wreathed in smiles and handed
him the entire amount of money then due for the
rent.</p>

<p class='c011'>That provoking agent had attended to them at
last, she said, and she was so glad, for it was very
mortifying to be owing any one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And <em>this</em> is what has been troubling you of
late?” said Mr. Howland, who was greatly pleased
at seeing her appear like herself again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you noticed it,” Adelaide replied, coloring
crimson, and adding hastily: “We have recently
been much annoyed and perplexed, but for
the future our agent will be prompt, and so shall
we.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether the agent referred to was prompt or not,
there seemed for several weeks to be plenty of
money at the white house on the hill—so much so,
in fact, that Adelaide did not, as usual, go to
Springfield to take her accustomed lesson, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>old Peggy, whose shabby dress was beginning to
create some gossip among the villagers, presented
quite a respectable appearance in her new gingham
and muslin cap. About this time, too, there was
sent by mail to Mr. Warren the sum of twenty-five
dollars, and as there was no word of explanation
accompanying it, he naturally felt curious to know
from whom it came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Elinor sent it, I am sure. It is exactly like
her,” said Alice, who was now entirely well, and
that afternoon, when her work was done, she went
up to see Miss Howland, whom she found suffering
from a severe headache, and in ministering to her
wants she entirely forgot to speak of the money.
The next day Miss Elinor was much worse, and for
many weeks was confined to her bed with a lingering
fever, which left her at last so nervous and low
that her physician advised a journey to the West
as the surest means of restoring her health. Her
only sister was living in Milwaukee, and thither
Mr. Howland, who began to be seriously alarmed,
tried to persuade her to go. For a time Miss Elinor
hesitated, and only consented at last on condition
that her brother promised not to engage himself to
Adelaide Huntington during her absence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bursting into a laugh, Mr. Howland assured her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>that she need have no fears of finding her station,
as mistress of his house, filled on her return, for
though Adelaide might possibly some day bear the
name of Howland, he could wait a while, and would
do so for his sister’s sake.</p>

<p class='c011'>With this promise Miss Elinor tried to be satisfied,
and after giving him many charges not to
neglect the blind man, she started for Milwaukee
in company with some friends who, like herself,
were westward bound.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_072.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was now the first of December. Miss
Elinor had been gone from home nearly
three months, and during this time Mr.
Howland had spent one-half of his evenings
at least with Adelaide Huntington, who marvelled
that he did not ask her to be his wife. But
the promise made to his sister must be kept, and so,
night after night, he came and went, while Adelaide
experienced fresh pangs of fear lest her deception
should be discovered ere Mr. Howland was secured.</p>

<p class='c011'>About this time there were rumors of a large
party to be given by Mrs. Hayes, the most fashionable
lady in Oakland, and knowing well how
the beauty of her person would be enhanced by a
party dress, Adelaide resolved to leave no means
unspared for the procuring of such a dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had always observed, she said, that Mr.
Howland was unusually attentive when she looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>unusually well, and there was no knowing what
would happen if she eclipsed all the ladies who
might be present at the party, and then, as day
after day went by, she grew impatient because no
letter came from one who, at the post-office, was
designated as ma’s provoking agent, but who at
home, with none but mother to hear, was called
by a different name. Fretting, however, was of no
avail—the provoking agent did not write, and her
purse contained only seven dollars.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could get the dress,” she said, “I might
possibly manage the rest,” and then, as she remembered
the dainty fabric which Alice Warren
had worn upon that memorable Christmas Eve,
she started to her feet exclaiming, “That’s a good
idea,” and ere her mother had time to question her
she was on her way to the brown house in the
hollow.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few weeks past Mr. Warren had been
seriously ill, and though Alice worked both early
and late, she could not procure for him the little
comforts which he needed and missed so much.
Miss Elinor’s words, Do not neglect the blind
man, had been forgotten, and many a weary night
had the blind man’s daughter bent with aching head
and tearful eyes over the piece of work which her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>increased cares had not permitted her to finish during
the day. They were indeed drinking the bitter
cup of poverty, and the sick man in his sleep was
moaning sadly for wine, which he said would make
him strong, when Adelaide Huntington entered the
humble room. Glancing hurriedly at the scanty
fire and empty wood-box, she thought:</p>

<p class='c011'>“They must be wretchedly poor—I dare say I
can get it for almost nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then seating herself by Alice’s side, she told at
once the object of her visit. She had never forgotten
the beautiful lace dress which Alice had
worn on the night of her party, and if there was
one thing more than another which she coveted, it
was that. In short she wished to know if Alice had
it now, and if so, would she sell it, telling no one
that it had ever belonged to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the first mention of the dress, Alice’s tears
began to flow, for it was almost the only relic of
the past which she possessed, and now, laying her
head in Adelaide’s lap she sobbed out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adelaide, my mother bought it for me,
and can I let it go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know which you need the most, that or
the money,” was Adelaide’s cold reply, while from
his pillow the sick man faintly murmured:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Something to make me well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was enough, and wiping her tears away,
Alice took from her trunk the dress, sighing deeply
as she recalled the night when first and last she
wore it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not know it was so exquisitely beautiful,”
was Adelaide’s mental comment as Alice shook out
the soft, fleecy folds, but she did not say so.
On the contrary she depreciated its value, saying,
it had turned yellow, was rather old-fashioned,
and a second-hand article at most, besides
being quite too short for her in its present condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this manner she paved the way to the price
which she finally offered, and which Alice at first
refused to take. Four dollars seemed so little for
what had cost so much. But Alice’s necessities
were great, and when Adelaide offered her another
dollar to change the dress as it would have to be
changed for her, she yielded, promising to have it
in readiness and bring it home on the night of the
party. After trying it on and giving numerous
directions as to the changes she wished to have
made, Adelaide arose to go, saying nothing concerning
the pay. With a beating heart Alice saw
her about to leave, and though it cost her a mighty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>effort to do so, she at last conquered her pride and
catching Adelaide’s shawl as she was passing out,
she said with quivering lips:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you only will pay me part to-day! Father
is sick, and we are so poor,” and the little blue
veined hands were clasped beseechingly together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s a dollar, if that will do you any good,”
said Adelaide, thrusting a bill into Alice’s hand,
and then hurrying away.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had no intention of cheating Alice out of
her pay, but she hated to part with her money, and
on her way home she thought of so many things
which she must have, that she began at last to wonder
if Alice would not just as soon take something
from the house, bread, or potatoes, or soap—she
heard old Peggy boasting of having made a barrel
full, and soap was a very useful article—she’d ask
Alice when she brought the dress! and, feeling a
good deal of confidence in her plan, she stopped at
Mr. Howland’s store, where she spent a portion of
her remaining six dollars for white kids, satin ribbon,
blonde lace and so forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she was leaving the store, she met Mr. Howland,
who accompanied her to the door, casually
asking if she knew how Mr. Warren was getting
along.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“It is some time since I was there,” he said,
“and I think of going round to-night. As he is
sick, they may perhaps be suffering.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, they are not,” Adelaide quickly rejoined,
“I have just been to see them myself. Mr.
Warren is no worse, and they are doing very well.
I gave Alice some work, too, paying her in advance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, on the whole, you think I had better spend
the evening with you,” said Mr. Howland, playfully
interrupting her, as he saw that one of his
clerks was desirous of speaking to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most certainly I do,” she answered laughingly,
as she passed into the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so that night, while her father slept, poor
Alice Warren trimmed her little lamp, and with a
heavy heart sat down to work upon the costly garment,
every thread of which seemed interwoven
with memories of the mother, who had bought it
for her. Occasionally, too, she lifted up her head,
and listened for the footsteps which now but seldom
came that way, for only once had Mr. Howland
been there since her father’s illness, and brushing
away a tear, she sighed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He does not care for such as we.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That afternoon she had heard the rumor that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the proud Miss Huntington was to be his wife,
and though the idea that she, little Alice Warren,
could ever be aught to him, had never entered her
mind, the news affected her painfully, and as she
sat alone that night, the world seemed darker,
drearier than it had ever been before, while the
future home of Richard Howland’s bride looked
very pleasant to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice,” came faintly from her father, and in a
moment Alice was at his side. “Alice, are you
sewing to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, father, I am sewing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought you finished the vest this afternoon.
What are you doing now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice hesitated. She could not tell him she had
sold her party dress, neither would she tell him a
lie, so she finally said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adelaide came here while you slept, and I am
fixing a dress for her to wear to Mrs. Hayes’ party.
She gave me a dollar for it, too, and to-morrow I
shall buy you the wine which Dr. Martin says you
need, and maybe I’ll get you some oranges, too.
Would you like some oranges, father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes,” the tremulous voice replied, and the
childish old man cried, as he thought that to-morrow
he would have the wine and the oranges, too.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>The morrow came, and with it came the delicacies
so long desired. But the sick man scarcely
tasted them; “some other time he might want them
more,” he said, and with a feeling of disappointment
Alice put them away, while her father, turning
wearily upon his pillow, prayed that the deep,
dark waters, through which he instinctively felt
that he must ere long pass, might not be suffered to
overflow.</p>

<p class='c011'>But to Alice there came no forebodings like
these. She only knew her father was very sick, and
she fancied that the luxuries to which he had been
accustomed would make him well again.</p>

<p class='c011'>So with untiring patience she worked on, thinking
how the money which Adelaide was to pay her
should be expended for her father’s comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas for the poor little girl, who, just as it was
growing dark on the night of the party, folded
carefully the finished dress, and then stole softly to
her father’s bedside, to see if he were sleeping. He
was very—very pale, and on his face there was a
look like that of her dead mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alice was not alarmed. She had never
thought it possible for him to die, so quiet, so
gentle, so uncomplaining he seemed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father” she said, “can you stay alone while I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>carry Adelaide her dress? She is to pay me more
than that dollar, and I will buy you ever so many
nice things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By and by,” he whispered, “it is early yet,”
and drawing Alice to him, he talked to her of her
mother, who, he said, seemed very near to him that
night—so near that he could almost feel her soft
hand clasp his own, just as it used to do in the
happy days gone by. And while he talked the darkness
in the room increased—the clock struck six,
and releasing his daughter Mr. Warren bade her go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He felt better,” he said, “and was not afraid to
stay alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must sleep till I return. I shall not be
gone long,” were Alice’s parting words, and going
out, she walked rapidly in the direction of Mrs.
Huntington’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a very unamiable mood Adelaide met her at
the door, chiding her for her delay, and saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I began to think you were never coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father has been worse, and I could not work
so fast,” was Alice’s meek reply, as she followed
Adelaide into the sitting-room, helping her try on
the dress, which the petulant young lady declared:</p>

<p class='c011'>Didn’t fit within a mile! It was too high in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>neck—too long in the waist—too short in the skirt,
and must be fixed before it was decent to wear!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t leave father so long,” said Alice, in
dismay, as she thought how much there was to be
done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll risk him,” returned Adelaide. “Any way,
when I hire anything done I expect it to suit me, or
I don’t pay, of course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This remark was well-timed, for Alice could not
go back without the money, and with a heavy heart
she sat down to her task. But the tears blinded her
eyes, and so impeded her progress that the clock
struck eight before her work was done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, put these flowers in my hair, and tie my
sash just as yours was tied,” said the heartless
Adelaide, as she saw Alice about to put on her
bonnet.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a box which stood upon the table lay the
bead purse, and glancing at that Alice did whatever
was required of her, nor scarcely felt a pang when
at last the toilet was completed, and Adelaide
Huntington stood before her arrayed in the selfsame
dress which she had worn but two short years
ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant you should dress me all the time,”
said Adelaide, glancing complacently at herself in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the mirror. “I meant you should dress me—mother
knows so little about such matters, and
then, too, she is sick up stairs with a violent headache,
but I do not need you any longer—what are
you waiting for?” she continued, as Alice made no
movement to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am waiting for the money which I want so
much to-night,” answered Alice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes, the money,” said Adelaide, making a
feint to examine the purse, which she knew was
empty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice knew it, too, all too soon, and sinking
down upon a little stool she cried aloud:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall we do? The wood is almost gone,
and I baked the last cake to-night. Oh, father,
father, what will you do to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adelaide Huntington was not hard-hearted
enough to be unmoved by this appeal, and forgetting
entirely the soap, she glided from the room
to which she soon returned, bringing a basket of
food for Alice, whom she comforted with the assurance
that she should be paid as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d no idea they were so poor,” said Adelaide
to herself, as the door closed upon Alice. “I wish
he would send the money so I could pay the debt
and have it off my mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Just then the village omnibus stopped at the
door, and Adelaide ran for a moment to show her
mother how she looked, then gathering up the
folds of her rich lace skirt, and throwing on her
shawl, she entered the carriage and was soon riding
toward the scene of gayety, while Alice Warren
was hurrying home, a nameless terror creeping into
her heart, and vaguely whispering that the morrow,
for which she had been so anxious, might bring her
a sorrow such as orphans only know.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_084.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
For a while after Alice left him, Mr.
Warren lay perfectly quiet, trying to
number the minutes, by counting each
tick of the clock, and wondering if it
were not time for Alice to return. While thus
engaged he fell asleep, and when at last he woke
there was a death-like faintness at his heart; his
lips were dry and parched, and he felt a strong desire
for water with which to quench his burning
thirst.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice,” he said feebly, “Alice, is that you? are
you here?” but to his call there came no answer,
and throughout the room there was heard no sound
save the steady ticking of the clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Why then did the blind man raise himself upon
his elbow and roll his sightless eyes around the
silent apartment. Did he hear aught in the deep
stillness? He thought he did—ay, he was sure he
did, and again he called:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Alice, Alice, are you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Alice made him no reply, and as the minutes
went by, the sick man grew delirious, talking of
the past, which seemed present with him now.
Then, as reason for a moment returned, he moaned:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Alice, will you never come? The fire is
going out and I am growing cold. Oh, must I die
alone at last?”</p>

<p class='c011'>No, not alone; for, crouched upon the hearthstone,
there sat a human form. It was the figure of
a man—a dark, hard-featured man; and often, as
the wailing cry came from the humble bed, it bowed
its head upon its hands and wept. Carefully, stealthily
through the door it had come while Mr.
Warren slept, and the deep black eyes, which
glowed at first like coals of living fire, grew dim
with tears as, glancing hurriedly around the room,
they saw how poor it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t there somebody here with me?” the sick
man said at last, as his quick ear caught the sound
of breathing. “Speak, isn’t there somebody here?”
he continued, while the figure on the hearthstone
glided noiselessly to the bedside, where it stood
erect, gazing pitifully upon the white, worn face
which, with the lamp-light shining on it, seemed of
a deathly hue.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>It was a strange sight, that statue standing
there so silently, and that blind old man trying
in vain to penetrate the darkness and learn who it
was that stood there beside him. Raising himself
at last in bed, and stretching out his arm, he touched
a hand colder even than his own, for guilt and fear
had chilled the blood of him who remained immovable,
while the trembling fingers passed nervously
over the face, through the hair, down the side, until
they reached the left hand, from whose fore-finger a
joint was gone. That missing joint, though we
have made no mention of it heretofore, was well
remembered by Hugo Warren, and it needed but
this proof to tell him who was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“William Huntington,” he hoarsely whispered,
and falling back upon his pillow, he wiped the
drops of perspiration from his face, for the presence
of that man, coming to him thus, awakened all the
bitter memories of the past. “William Huntington,”
he gasped, “why are you here on this night
of all others, when my lost wife seems present with
me, and my ruined hopes pass in sad review before
my mind. Say, have you come to add the last drop
in the brimming bucket?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a moment’s silence, and then, falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>upon his knees, William Huntington made answer
to the man he had so wronged.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not come to insult you, but rather to seek
the forgiveness which I know I do not merit. Only
say that you forgive me, Mr. Warren—let me once
hold your hand in token of reconciliation, and then
do with me what you will. A life within a felon’s
cell is preferable far, to the remorse which I have
carried with me for two long, dreary years. Say,
will you not forgive me?” he continued, and the
strong man’s voice was choked with tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive you, William,” Mr. Warren replied,
“I might perhaps forgive you, were my fortune all
you wrested from me, but when I think of my lost
Helen, my heart is turned to steel, for you killed
her, William Huntington—you killed my precious
wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, it was my base act which killed her,
it is true, still I have made you some amends. I
saved your daughter’s life, you know, else I had
never dared to seek your face again,” said Mr.
Huntington, interrupting him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You saved Alice’s life?” the excited man
rejoined, and the hand which had withdrawn itself
beneath the bed-clothes now came forth again, feeling
eagerly for the bowed head, on which it rested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>forgivingly, while he continued, “It was you, then
who took her from the river, and laid her in my
arms—you who saved me from a darker night than
any I have ever known. Yes, William, because you
did this good to me, you are forgiven, fully, freely
forgiven—but why have you not told of it before?
Where have you been, and did your family know
aught of this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My family know aught of this?” repeated Mr.
Huntington. “Can it be I am deceived?” and
then, with the shaking hand still resting on his
head, he told how he had wandered far and wide,
seeking rest and finding none, for ever present to
his mind was a white-haired, sightless man, weeping,
o’er his pale, dead wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the far off California land he had dug for
gold, vainly hoping by this means some time to
make amends for the ruin he had wrought. At last,
as the burden of remorse grew heavier to bear, he
sought his home to see once more the faces of his
wife and child, hoping, too, that the forgiveness he
so much desired might be obtained.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I found them here,” said he—“found my wife
and Adelaide working hard and secretly, lest the
world should know how poor they were. I met my
daughter first, and Heaven forgive me if I do her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>wrong, I thought she was not glad to see me. I
questioned her of you, and learned that you were
here, too, and very poor. You were fully determined,
she said, to revenge yourself on me should I
ever be found, and she urged me not to let my
presence here be known, until she had tried to procure
for me your forgiveness. My wife did not
seem to understand your feelings, for she had never
seen you, and she wished me to remain; but my
daughter’s fears and my own dread of a convict’s
fate prevailed, and trusting to Adelaide’s promise
that she would eventually obtain your pardon for
me, I left them again and became a second time a
wanderer. I intended to take the cars at West
Oakland, and was following the course of the river,
when, pausing for a moment to rest, I saw you
approaching, and hid behind the alders, one moment
resolving to throw myself at your feet, and
again fearing to do so, for guilt had made me
cowardly and weak. The rest of that day’s incidents
you know. I saved your daughter’s life, but I
dared not speak, lest I should be betrayed. My
wet clothes made it necessary for me to return to
the house, where I told what I had done, and asked
if this would not atone. My wife said yes, but
Adelaide was fearful still. She would see you herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>she said, and she did see you that very day, but
you refused. ‘The law must take its course,’ you
said, ‘even though I saved a hundred lives.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never! so help me Heaven!” Mr. Warren
exclaimed. “Such words as those never passed my
lips, and till this moment I knew not who it was
that saved my child. Forgive me, William, but she
lied, that girl Adelaide. There was treachery in her
voice when she sat at my feet and asked me not to
tell of your misdeeds, lest disgrace should fall on
her. People thought her mother was a widow, she
said, and she would rather they should not know
that you ran away to escape a prison home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adelaide, my child, my child, why did you
thus deceive me?” the wretched father groaned,
while Mr. Warren continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never tried to find you, William, or sought to
do you harm; but go on and tell me where you have
been since that time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remained at home a day or two, hiding from
the sight of men,” Mr. Huntington replied, “and
then one night I went away, thinking to make for
my family a home in the distant West, where you
would never find me. But no spot could be home
to me with that load upon my mind, so at last I
determined to see you myself, and beg for your forgiveness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>They think me far away, my wife and
Adelaide, for I only paused a moment at their door.
Looking through the half-closed blind I saw your
daughter there, and knowing that you must be
alone I hastened on, entering your dwelling while
you slept, and now it remains for you to do with
me what you will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing, William, I shall do nothing—only
raise me up, my breath is going from me,” Mr.
Warren gasped.</p>

<p class='c011'>The faintness he had experienced once before
had returned again, brought on by the excitement
of what he had heard, and Mr. Huntington, when
he saw the corpse-like pallor stealing over his face,
feared that he was dying. He was not afraid of
death, but the world, he knew, was a suspicious one,
and he would rather the man he had so wronged
should not die alone with him. Just then he heard
without, a footstep coming near, and thinking it
must be Alice, he hurried to the door, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quick! your father, I fear, is dying!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In a moment the person thus addressed stood at
Mr. Warren’s bedside, and when the fainting man
came back to consciousness he whispered softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, Mr. Howland, for coming here
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It was Richard Howland who stood there side
by side with one whom he readily recognized as the
stranger who had saved the life of Alice Warren.
He had started for the party, going through the
hollow as the shortest route, and was passing Mr.
Warren’s gate, when the words, “Be quick! your
father, I fear, is dying,” arrested his attention,
bringing him at once into the presence of the blind
man whom he had so long neglected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not know you were so ill,” he was about
to say, when Alice entered the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father,” she cried, bounding to his side, “are
you worse?” and then, as her eyes fell upon Mr.
Huntington, the hot blood stained her face and
neck, for she knew who he was, and marveled much
that he was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice,” said Mr. Warren, “I have forgiven
William Huntington because he saved your life,
though he dared not let us know it then, for Adelaide
had said I thirsted for revenge. He has suffered
much, my child, and you, I am sure, will sanction
my forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in vain that Alice attempted to speak,
so astonished was she at what she had heard, and,
misinterpreting her silence, Mr. Huntington advanced
toward her, saying, imploringly:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“Hear, me, young lady, and you will perhaps be
willing to forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then very rapidly he repeated in substance the
story he had told her father, touching as lightly as
possible on Adelaide’s duplicity, but still making
the matter plain to Alice and clear to him, who,
with clasped hands and wildly beating heart, listened
breathlessly to the strange tale he heard.
Richard Howland was undeceived at last, and the
girl he had almost loved was revealed to him in her
true character, as an artful, designing woman. The
father, who he supposed was dead, stood there, a
living, breathing man, identical, he was sure, with
the agent of whom he had often heard, and, worse
than all, the people against whom she had breathed
her dark insinuations, were innocent of evil; the
wrong was on the other side, and he had been her
dupe; had even thought it possible to call that girl
his wife. His wife! how he loathed the very idea
now that he knew her guilt, and how his conscience
smote him for having ever wronged in thought the
helpless old blind man and his gentle, fair-haired
daughter. They had suffered, too, from his neglect,
but he could make amends for that, and his heart
went out in pity toward Alice as he contrasted her
former life with her present dreary lot. The party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>was forgotten, and while Adelaide, in a most impatient
mood, watched each fresh arrival, he, for
whom she watched in vain, smoothed the tumbled
pillow, bathed the burning brow, or brought the
cooling draught, and then spoke words of comfort
to the weeping Alice, who read upon his face, and
that of Mr. Huntington, a confirmation of her fears.</p>

<p class='c011'>But not that night did Mr. Warren die, though
the physician, for whom Mr. Huntington was sent,
would give no hope. The disease had assumed a
most alarming form, he said, and Mr. Howland’s
hand rested pityingly on the bowed head of the
young girl who was soon to be an orphan. The
morning came, and then, as it was necessary for
him to go home for a time, he left both father and
child to the care of Mr. Huntington, promising to
send down one of his domestics, and to return himself
ere long.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The morning train from Albany had thundered
through the town, and Mr. Howland
was about returning to the hollow,
when hasty footsteps were heard in the
hall, and in a moment his sister stood before him.
She had traveled night and day since leaving
Milwaukee, she said, but she didn’t mind it at all,
she was so impatient to be at home and tell him
what she had heard, and, without so much as untying
her bonnet, Miss Elinor continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you all the time they were impostors—but
men have so little sense. I’m glad I ain’t a
man, though if I were, no woman would ever
impose on me as that Adelaide has on you. Why,
instead of taking music lessons, as she pretends to
do, she goes to Springfield after work, and the
satchel you more than once carried for her, had in
it vests and shirts, and mercy knows what—tell me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that wasn’t a wristband I saw under the lounge.
I guess I know a wristband. They are just as poor
as they can be, and sew for Mr. Lincoln’s store in
Springfield, for Mrs. Lincoln’s cousin told me so.
I met her in Milwaukee, and when she knew I was
from Oakland, she spoke of Adelaide, and asked
me if I knew her. I told her yes, and then she
asked if she were married yet, saying she hoped she
was, for it seemed a pity that a stylish-looking girl
like her should be obliged to sew for a living. Of
course I questioned her, learning what I’ve told
you, and, worse than all the rest, Adelaide made
this lady believe that she was going to marry a very
wealthy man, who had a most delightful home, with
one incumbrance, which she should soon manage to
dispose of, and that incumbrance was a dried-up
old maid sister! Do you hear that, Richard Howland?
A dried-up old maid sister. That means
me!” and the highly scandalized lady walked up
and down the room, upsetting, in her wrath, both
her traveling basket and band-box, which last in a
measure diverted her attention, for no woman,
whether married or single, can think of anything
else when her “best bonnet” is in danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Picking up the box, and assuring herself that its
contents were unharmed, she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Why don’t you say something, Richard? Are
you not surprised at what I have told you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not particularly,” he answered, and coming to
her side he repeated to her the story he had heard
from Adelaide’s own father, so long supposed to be
dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The trollop! the jade!” ejaculated Miss Elinor.
“I understand her perfectly. She wished to keep
up appearances, and make her father stay away
until she became your wife, and you couldn’t help
yourself. Dried-up old maid, indeed! I’ll teach
her to call me names. But what of Mr. Warren
and little Alice? I’ll go to them at once,” and notwithstanding
her recent fatiguing journey, the energetic
woman started for the hollow, saying to her
brother, who accompanied her, “I am determined
upon one thing, Richard. If Mr. Warren dies,
Alice will live with us and have the best chamber,
too. Poor little creature, how she must have
suffered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They found both Mr. Warren and Alice asleep,
but Miss Elinor’s kiss awoke the latter, who uttered
a cry of joy at the sight of her friend and benefactress.
The sick man, too, ere long, awoke, but
only to doze again, and as the day wore on he continued
in a state of stupor, from which it was difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>to rouse him. Just before the sun was setting,
however, consciousness returned, and he asked for
Alice, who in a moment was at his side. Winding
his arm lovingly around her neck, he prayed that
the God of the fatherless would not forsake her
when she should be alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going from you, Alice,” he said, “going
to your mother, who has waited for me all day, and
the pain of death would scarce be felt did I know
what would become of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell him, Richard,” whispered Miss Elinor,
and advancing to the bedside, Mr. Howland said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your daughter shall live with me when you
are gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you,” came feebly from the dying
man, while the fair head resting on his bosom was
a moment uplifted, and Mr. Howland never forgot
the grateful, glad expression of the soft blue eyes
which looked into his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, too, will care for Alice so long as my life is
spared,” said Mr. Huntington, who had been there
all the day, and again from the white lips a faint
“God bless you” came.</p>

<p class='c011'>Slowly toward the western horizon sank the
setting sun, and when at last his farewell beams
looked into that room of death, they shone on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>frosty hair and still white face of one who was no
longer blind, for to him the light of a better world
had been revealed, and the eyes so long in darkness
here were opened to the glories of the New
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every necessary care was bestowed upon the
dead, and then, leaving the orphaned Alice in Miss
Elinor’s arms, with Mr. Howland standing near and
speaking to her an occasional word of comfort,
Mr. Huntington started for his home, walking
slowly, sadly; for his heart was full of sorrow—sorrow
for the dead and sorrow for his only child,
who had so cruelly deceived him. What her motive
was he could not guess, unless it were that she
dreaded the disgrace his presence might bring upon
her, and when he thought of this, he half resolved
to leave her forever, but love for his wife prevailed,
and with an aching heart he kept on his way.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Restless and impatient Adelaide had passed the
day in wondering what had happened to Mr. Howland,
and why he was not at the party. She had
confidently expected him there, but he had disappointed
her, and the lace dress with which she
hoped to impress him was worn for naught.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Parties were bores, anyway,” she said, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>she hoped she should never attend another so long
as her name was Adelaide Huntington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In this unamiable mood she fretted until late in
the afternoon, when old Peggy, who had been sent
on an errand to the village, returned, bringing the
news that Mr. Warren was not expected to live,
and that she saw Mr. Howland entering the door as
she passed. Then lowering her voice to a whisper,
she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right up against the window was a man’s
head, which looked so like your father that I stopped
a little, hoping he would turn his face one side,
but he didn’t, and I came along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father,” repeated Adelaide, “isn’t within a
hundred miles of here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still the idea troubled her even more than the
news of Mr. Warren’s illness, and after old Peggy
left the room, she turned to her mother saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldn’t it be mean if father had come back
and gone to see Mr. Warren?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose it would be right, though,” returned
her mother, while Adelaide continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right or wrong, nobody wants him turning up
bodily just yet, for Mr. Howland is so squeamish
about a little deception that any chance of winning
him would be rather slim, if he knew father was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>dead as he believes him to be. If I secure him before
he finds it out, he can’t help himself, and I
wish he’d either propose or let it alone. I declare,
mother, I think it is your duty as a prudent, careful
parent to ask what his intentions are. You can tell
him there is a great deal of talk about his coming
here so much, and unless he is serious, you prefer
that he should discontinue his visits, hinting, of
course, that you fear my affections are already too
deeply enlisted for my future happiness should he
not be in earnest. Say, mother, will you tell him
this when he comes again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Huntington at first refused, but Adelaide’s
entreaties finally prevailed, and it was decided that
when Mr. Howland next visited them he should be
questioned concerning his intentions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I hope he’ll come to-night,” said Adelaide,
and feeling confident that he would, she made some
changes in her dress, smoothed her glossy hair, and
then, just as it was growing dark, lay down upon
the lounge, building castles of the future, and
wondering if she should be Adelaide Huntington
one year from that day.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she lay thus, she heard the gate open and
shut—a heavy footstep was coming up the walk,
and thinking it must be Mr. Howland she assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>a half reclining posture, which she fancied was
careless and graceful, and then awaited the appearance
of her expected visitor. He did not ring, and
she heard his step in the hall. Nearer and nearer
he came, his hand was on the knob, and as the door
swung back the large black eyes, which turned at
first so eagerly in that direction, flashed their surprise
and anger, not on Richard Howland, but on
William Huntington, who keenly felt the coldness
of his welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father,” she exclaimed, “where did you come
from?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I came from Mr. Warren’s,” he answered. “He
is dead, but I have been forgiven, and can once
more walk the earth a free and fearless man.
Adelaide,” he continued, and in the tone of his
voice and gleam of his eye there was something
which made the guilty girl tremble, “I have heard
that of you which fills me with grief. Oh, my
child, how could you so shamefully deceive me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?” she asked, in well-feigned surprise, for she would not admit anything
until she knew how far she was implicated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very briefly her father repeated to her what he
had heard from Mr. Warren, and then awaited her
answer. At first she thought to deny the charge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>but she dared not give the lie to one then lying
dead not far away, so she remained silent, trying in
vain to frame some excuse with which to appease
her father, and also to find some way of again binding
Alice to secrecy, so that Mr. Howland should
never hear of her falsehoods. He would, perhaps,
excuse her deception with regard to her father
when she told him, as she should do, that she had
done it for the sake of her mother, who could not
endure to have the matter known, and if the rest
were kept from him, all might yet end well.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment she remembered what Peggy
had said, and with a faint voice she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does any one know this but yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Warren’s daughter knows it,” he returned.
“And the young man—Howland is his name—knows
it, too, for he was there all night and heard
my conversation with Alice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Howland!” Adelaide fairly screamed, and
in the terrified expression of her face the motive for
her conduct was revealed to her father, who rather
enjoyed than otherwise the passionate tears of
anger and mortification which she shed at finding
herself thus betrayed to one whom she had loved as
well as such as she could love.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I understand you perfectly,” said Mr. Huntington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>advancing toward her as she lay weeping on
the lounge, “and your punishment is just; for a
child who can abuse its father as you have abused
me, ought never to be the wife of a man like Mr.
Howland. I will not reproach you further with
your guilt,” he continued, “for your sin has found
you out, and I leave you to your own reflections.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So saying, he passed on in quest of his wife,
whose welcome to the repentant man was far more
cordial than that of his daughter had been.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adelaide was, indeed, sorely punished, for all
hope of winning Mr. Howland was gone, and, as
the days wore on, she experienced more and more
that the way of the transgressor is hard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story of Mr. Huntington’s existence and return
to his family circulated rapidly, and with it,
hand in hand, went the rumor of the wrong he had
once done to the blind man, who by the people of
Oakland was honored more in death than he had
been in life, for they came in crowds to his funeral,
gazing pityingly at the white face of the dead, and
then staring curiously at the dark-browed stranger
who was said to be William Huntington. Adelaide
was not there, for Miss Elinor, a little given to
gossip, it may be, had kindly remembered her, and
numerous were the exaggerated stories afloat concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the deception she had practiced both upon
her father and the villagers. Like most people she
had one so-called friend who dutifully kept her informed
with regard to all that was said concerning
her, and completely overwhelmed with shame and
mortification, she resolved to keep herself secluded
at home, where she vented her disappointment in
harsh language and bitter tears, particularly when,
on the day succeeding the funeral, she heard that
Miss Elinor had taken Alice to live with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>But little did Miss Elinor care for her anger.
The world to her was brighter now than it had been
for many years, and with something of a mother’s
love, her heart went out toward the orphan to whom
she had given a home. Adelaide, however, was not
forgotten, and the good lady was certainly excusable
if, when riding with her protege, she did
frequently order Jim to take them round to High
Street, bidding him drive slowly past the house of
the Huntingtons. But if in this way she thought to
obtain a glimpse of Adelaide, she was mistaken, for
the young lady was never visible, though, safely
hidden behind the curtain, she herself seldom failed
to see the carriage and the little figure in black,
who she instinctively felt would some day be her
rival.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The bitterest drop of all in Adelaide’s cup of
mortification was the knowledge that Mr. Howland
had once thought to make her his wife, for he told
her so in a letter written three weeks subsequent to
Mr. Warren’s death. It is true he had never committed
himself by words, but he had done so by
actions, and honor demanded an explanation. So
he wrote at last, and though it was a most polite
and gentlemanly note, its contents stung her to her
inmost soul, and casting it into the fire she watched
it as it turned to ashes, feeling the while as if her
own heart were charred and blistered with its load
of guilt and shame. There were no more trips to
Springfield now, for concealment of labor was no
longer necessary, and the satchel Miss Elinor
taunted her brother with having carried so often,
lay useless upon the closet shelf.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll die before I’ll do that—father may support
us,” Adelaide had said when her mother suggested
that they take in sewing from Mr. Howland’s store.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Huntington did do his best toward
maintaining his family, but popular opinion was
against him. He had defrauded his employer once—he
might do so again—and so all looked upon
him with distrust, making it sometimes very hard
for him to procure even the common necessaries of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>life. His health, too, had become impaired, both
by exposure and the mental anguish he had so long
endured, and night after night his labored breathing
and hacking cough smote painfully on the ear
of his wife, whose love no circumstances could
destroy.</p>

<p class='c011'>One morning, toward the middle of February,
he left them as usual, but he was soon brought
back with a broken limb, which he had received
from a fall upon the ice. For him to work was now
impossible, and Adelaide no longer objected when
her mother proposed that Peggy should be sent for
sewing to Mr. Howland, who gave it to her readily,
manifesting much concern for Mr. Huntington,
whom Peggy represented as being in a most deplorable
condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two or three days afterward, as he was leaving
the store, he received a message from the sick man,
who wished to see him, and in a short time he stood
at the bedside of Mr. Huntington, who told, in a
few words, why he had been sent for.</p>

<p class='c011'>They could not keep that house—they must
rent a cheaper one, and if no tenant for the brown
house in the hollow had been obtained, would Mr.
Howland let him have it? He would try hard
when he got well to pay the rent, and the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>man’s eyes filled with tears, just as little Alice
Warren’s had done when words similar to these
escaped her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, he could have it, Mr. Howland said, and
the sum he asked for it was just what Mr. Warren
had paid; then fearing lest Adelaide by chance
should enter the room, he hastened away, pondering
upon the changes which a few short weeks had
brought to the haughty girl, who, when she heard
of her father’s arrangement, flew into a violent rage,
declaring she would kill herself before she’d live
in that little shanty.</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither her wrath nor her tears could shake
her father’s determination, and when the first April
sun had set, and the warm spring moon had risen,
wretched, hopeless and weary, Adelaide Huntington
crept up to her bed beneath the rafters, covering
her head with the sheet, lest she should see the
white-haired, sightless specter, which, to her disordered
fancy, seemed haunting that low-roofed
dwelling.</p>

It is summer again—“the leafy month of
June”—and in the spacious, well-kept
grounds of Richard Howland hundreds
of roses are blossoming, but none so fair
and beautiful to the owner of these grounds as the
rose which blossoms within the house—the brighthaired,
gentle Alice, who, when the grief-laden
clouds of adversity were overshadowing her life, did
not dream that she could ever be as happy as she
is in her new home. The grass-grown grave in the
quiet valley is not neglected, nor he who rests there
forgotten, but though her tears fall often on the
sod, she cannot wish the blind man back in a world
which was so truly dark to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Alice has learned to be happy in her luxurious
home—happy in the tender love which Miss
Elinor ever lavishes upon her, and happy, too, in
the quiet brother-like affection of him who seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>to her the embodiment of every manly virtue. He
does not talk often with her, for Richard Howland
deals not so much in words as deeds, but in a
thousand little ways he tells her he is glad to have
her there. And this is all he tells her, so that
neither she nor his more discerning sister dream
how sweet to him is the music of the childish voice,
which often in the gathering twilight sings some
song of the olden time; nor do they know, when
returning home at night, how wistfully he glances
toward the window where Alice is wont to sit, and
if they did know it, they could not fathom his
meaning, for when the golden hair and bright
young face is there, he always turns aside, lingering
without, as if within there were no maiden fair,
whose eyes of blue played wilder notes upon his
heart-strings than the dark, proud orbs of Adelaide
had ever done. Even he does not know he loves
her, so quietly that love has come—creeping over
him while he slept—stealing over him when he
woke—whispering to him in the dingy counting-room,
and bidding him cast frequent glances at the
western sky, to see if it were not time that he were
home. He only knows that he is very happy, and
that his happiness is in some way connected with
the childish form which flits before him like a sunbeam,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>filling his home with light and joy. It had
never occurred to him that she might sometime go
away, and leave in his household a void which no
other one could fill, and when one day, toward the
last of June, his sister said to him, “Alice has
received a letter from an old friend of her mother,
asking her to take charge of the juvenile department
of a young ladies’ seminary in B——,” he
started as if he had been smitten with a heavy blow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice teach school!” he exclaimed. “Alice
go away from—me—from you, I mean. Preposterous!
She don’t, of course, think of accepting the
offer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she does. I’d no idea she had so much
decision,” and Miss Elinor’s scissors cut quite a
hole in the embroidery on which she has worked
ever since we knew her. “I remonstrated when she
told me she should return an affirmative answer, but
it did no good. She never intended long to burden
people on whom she had no claim, she said. She
would rather be independent, and though she was
very happy here, she felt it her duty to earn her
own living, now that an opportunity was presented.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Earn her own living,” repeated Mr. Howland,
“just as though she cost anybody anything. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>is some other reason, and if I didn’t know you as
well as I do, I should be inclined to think the fault
was with you. Maybe you do sometimes scold her,
Elinor?” and he fixed his eyes inquiringly upon
his sister’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Elinor had striven hard to restrain the tears
which thoughts of parting with her favorite induced,
and thus far she had succeeded, but when
she heard her brother’s remark, they burst forth at
once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Me</em> scold Alice?” was all she could articulate,
as with a deeply injured air she left the room, while
her brother, seizing his hat, hurried off to the store,
where he remained the entire day, trying to think
how it would seem to him when he knew that Alice
was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>It didn’t seem at all</em>, either to him or to his
clerks, for never before had he been so irritable and
cross, finding fault with the most trivial matters;
chiding the cash-boy for moving too fast, and the
head clerk for moving too slow; refusing to trust
the widow Simpson, whom he had trusted all his
life, and making himself so generally disagreeable
that the young men in his employ were not sorry
when, about five o’clock, they saw him start for
home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“I’m glad he’s gone, anyway, dern him!” muttered
Check, who had been, perhaps, the greatest
sufferer, and with a most contemptuous whistle he
looked after the retreating figure of his master.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice was not in the yard—nor in the parlor—nor
in the house. He knew it by that indefinable
feeling which we experience when the one we love
the best is absent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had gone to walk by the river,” Miss Elinor
said, when questioned, asking him in the same
breath why he didn’t come home to dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not hungry,” he replied. “The prospect
of losing Alice has taken my appetite away. Do
you think she would stay with us, if I were to adopt
her as my daughter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Elinor didn’t think anything. She had not
quite forgiven his unjust remark in the morning,
and failing to obtain satisfaction from her, he
started in quest of Alice, who, he was sure, would
listen favorably to his plan of adoption. The tree
where she and her father sat on that afternoon when
she had come so near to death, was her favorite
resort, and here he now found her, thinking of the
coming time when she would be gone. It had cost
her a struggle to decide the matter, but it was best,
she thought; she could not always be dependent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and that very night she would answer “Yes.” But
she wondered why she should feel so sad, or why
the thought of leaving Mr. Howland should make
her pain harder to bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall miss both him and his sister so much,”
she unconsciously said aloud, “I shall miss them
both, but him the most.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why then do you go?” came to her startled
ear, and Richard Howland stood before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Springing to her feet she blushed and stammered
out something about the watch-dog Ponto, whom
she should miss. But it would not do. Mr.
Howland was not to be deceived, and in her telltale
face he knew the watch-dog Ponto meant himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alice,” said he, “sit down with me upon the
bank, and tell me why you wish to leave us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alice obeyed, but neither of them spoke until
Mr. Howland, growing suddenly very bold, wound
his arm around her waist, and drew her to his side.
It was the first time in his life he had ever found
himself in a position like this, and though it was
very novel—very strange—he liked it. He forgot,
too, all about the adoption, and bending low, so
that in case of an emergency his lips could touch
her cheek, he whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Alice—”</p>

<p class='c011'>But what else he said the murmuring river never
told, neither the summer air which lifted the shining
tresses falling over his arm, nor yet the little bird,
which from the overhanging bough looked archly
down upon them, shutting its round, bright eye
with a knowing look as if it understood that scene.
It did understand, and the sight of them sitting
there thus brought to mind the dainty nest up in the
maple tree, where its own loved mate was waiting,
and when at last the maiden lifted up her head, it
plumed its wings for flight and flew away, singing
as it flew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s won—she’s won.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That night Alice, instead of Mr. Howland, was
missing from the table, and when Miss Elinor
sought her in her room, she was surprised at the
abruptness with which the young girl threw her
arms around her neck and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am happy—oh, so happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, with the twilight shadows gathering
around, Alice told her story to the wondering lady,
who in her joy forgave her brother for his unjust
insinuation, and folding the orphan girl lovingly
in her arms, she told her how gladly she should
welcome her as a sister. It was known ere long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>all over town that the wealthy Mr. Howland was
to wed the blind man’s daughter, and the rude
brown rafters of the cottage in the hollow never
witnessed so fierce a storm of passion and of tears
as on the night when first to Adelaide came tidings
that the man she so much loved had given himself
to another. To William Huntington, however, the
news brought joy and gladness. He had recovered
from his broken limb, but his health did not
improve, and now he seldom left his home. Still
he did whatever he could do for his family, and the
little yard in front of his house was filled with
flowers, which he tended with the utmost care, and
sold in small bouquets to such of the villagers as
wished to buy. When he heard that Alice was to
be a bride ere the summer days were gone, he set
apart his choicest flowers, watching them with
jealous care, and experiencing a childish delight in
thinking how he would form a rare bouquet, worthy
of her to whom it should be given.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no reason why the marriage should
be delayed, Mr. Howland said, and so one balmy
night, when the harvest moon was in its infancy, St.
Luke’s Church was filled to overflowing, and the
same man, who, over Hugo Warren’s grave, had
read the burial service, now spoke the solemn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>words which made one flesh of two. And when
the rite was ended and Alice was a bride, from the
three towers of Oakland there rang a merry peal,
for Mr. Howland was greatly honored by the
citizens who thus would keep his wedding night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Across the grassy meadow, up the wooded hill,
and down into the hollow, floated the music of
those bells, awakening an answering note of joy in
every heart save that of the wretched Adelaide,
who, grinding her teeth together, fled to her lonely
garret and stuffed cotton in her ears, so as to shut
out the hateful sound, which told her of her rival’s
happiness. Anon, and from the rocky heights
which overlooked the town, and from the village
green, there shone a lurid light. Bonfires had been
kindled by the workmen from the factory and shop,
and among the boys who danced around the blazing
fire, none threw his hat so high or cut so many
antics as did the little Check, who in his bran-new
suit, the gift of Mr. Howland, forgot his grievances
on that memorable day when his master tried to
see how it would seem, to live without Alice
Warren.</p>

<p class='c011'>From her window Adelaide looked out upon
the scene, shedding bitter tears of envy and of rage,
then, wishing she had never seen the light of day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>she sought her solitary pillow and cried herself to
sleep, while the song and the dance moved joyously
on, and the gentle bride, in her robes of white,
looked lovingly up to him who was her all in all.
Nor were the inmates of the brown house in the
hollow forgotten by Alice in her prosperity. From
Mr. Huntington she had received a beautiful
bouquet; it was all, save his blessing, that he had
to give, he said, and Alice prized it the more when
she knew how carefully he had watched each
opening bud, shielding it alike from storm and
noonday heat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will remember him for this,” she thought,
and many a timely gift found its way to the brown
cottage where it was sorely needed, for as the fall
advanced Mr. Huntington grew worse, and to the
other labors of his family was added the task of
ministering to him and providing for his wants.</p>

<p class='c011'>As yet, no rent for the cottage had been paid,
and Miss Elinor, when she remembered the ugly
name which Adelaide had called her, secretly
wished she might be turned into the street. But
her brother was more forgiving, and when Alice’s
birthday came, he gave her the brown house in the
hollow, telling her playfully that she must collect
the rent of her own property!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“And I <em>would</em> do it too,” spoke up Miss Elinor,
who, nevertheless, was just as sure then of what
Alice intended to do as she was next morning when
she saw upon her sister’s writing-desk a receipt in
full for the rent, and heard Alice bid a servant take
it, with sundry other things, to the brown house in
the hollow as a Christmas gift from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Surely it is more blessed to give than to receive,
and the prayer which the sick man breathed for
Alice Howland was worth far more to her than the
paltry sum which she had lost by doing what she
did. Adelaide, too, was softened, for the pangs of
poverty were beginning to be keenly felt, and when
the servant turned to go, she said to him, with
quivering lip:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell Mrs. Howland that <em>I</em> thank her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another year has nearly gone, and from the
windows of the cottage there shines a glimmering
light, while gathered round the hearth three lonely
women sit. They are now indeed alone—the bed
in the corner is empty—the husband and father is
gone. When the last May flowers were blooming,
and the voice of spring was on the hills, strong
men carried him out into the open air, and in the
village churchyard, not far from Hugo Warren’s
grave, they laid the weary one to rest. William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Huntington had saved the life of Richard Howland’s
wife, and for this reason his family were not
neglected, though Miss Elinor took good care that
not enough assistance should be given to them “to
keep the trollop, Adelaide, from working.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Richard Howland’s home all is joy and gladness,
and though the curtains of one room are
dropped, and the blinds are closely shut, it is only
because the fussy old nurse will have it so, and not
because the young mother is in any danger now.
In the crib there sleeps a sturdy boy, and the
bottom of his cambric petticoat is trimmed with the
veritable embroidery which we have often seen in
the hands of Miss Elinor, who is the baby’s aunt.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had fully expected that it would bear her
name, but it proved a Betsey Trotwood affair, and
when the Christmas bells are ringing, and the star
of Bethlehem gleams on the walls of the old stone
church, she will stand as sponsor for the little boy,
to whom in memory of the blind man now singing
to the praise of Bethlehem’s child, will be given the
name of “Hugo Warren.”</p>

It was Christmas morning, and everywhere
the merry bells were ringing and telling
again the story, which, though more than
eighteen hundred years old, is always
sweet, always new—the story of Bethlehem’s babe,
for whose birthday we keep the Christmas-tide.
All over the northern hills the December snow was
lying, and the wind was sharp and cold as it went
singing past the windows of the houses where so
many eager, happy children ate their Christmas
cakes, or counted their Christmas toys. But far
away in the south land it was like summer still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and the orange-trees were fresh, and green, and
beautiful, with the yellow fruit and the white
blossoms showing among the leaves. Upon the
highest branch of a tall orange-tree which grew
upon the bank of the river St. John, a Red-bird
was sitting, and listening to a Paroquet, which, on a
magnolia near by, was dressing its bright plumage,
and talking to his neighbor, the Red-bird.</p>

<p class='c011'>After wishing him a merry Christmas, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so, Mrs. Red, you are still alive! Why,
we all thought you were dead, and Mr. Red wore
mourning for a month, and then—but never mind.
Have you been up to the old nest among the yellow
jasmine? If not, I advise you to stay away; but
say, where have you been this year or more? Tell
me about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It seemed strange to me, who was sitting on a
bench beneath the magnolia-tree, to hear birds
talking together after this fashion, and remembering
the children at the North who had never seen a
Paroquet, nor a magnolia, nor a Red-bird, nor an
orange-tree, I said to myself, I will write down
what these birds are saying, and sometime, perhaps,
I’ll send it to the little ones at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this, as nearly as I could understand it, was
the story the Red-bird told.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“You may well ask me where I have been,
Mr. Paroquet,” said the Red-bird, “but
you can keep your Merry Christmas
to yourself, for it is not a merry
Christmas with me. My heart is as heavy as lead,
and if it were not that I dreaded the cold so much,
I’d fly to the North, where they are having a grand
time to-day with their Christmas trees, and the
children all so happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fly to the North!” said Mr. Paroquet, with a
shudder. “Fly to that horrid place where they
have ice and snow the year round, with nothing
green or bright, unless it’s that Christmas-tree you
speak of! Pray, may I ask what kind of a tree
that is? Is it like this magnolia, or that palm
across the river, waving its fans in the breeze, or
that orange-tree where you are sitting? And what
kind of fruit does it bear? Icicles, or what?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Icicles!” And Mrs. Red laughed a merry,
rippling kind of laugh which did me good to hear,
for there was something very sad in the expression
of her face, as if she had lost every friend she ever
had. “Little you know of the North and what
they have there. I’ll wager now you never heard
of the place before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haven’t I, though?” Mr. Paroquet returned.
“Didn’t one of those men from the North shoot the
first Mrs. Paroquet one morning, just after breakfast,
when she had gone out to take the air, and I
was watching the three little birds in the nest?
And didn’t he take her away to that place they call
New York, and didn’t I hear afterward from a
robin who comes down here every winter that they
<em>stuffed</em> her, and put glass eyes in her, and strung her
on a wire frame, and set her up in somebody’s
parlor for an ornament, to be admired? My dead
wife <em>stuffed</em>!—and such a time as I had with the
little ones, who kept tumbling out of the nest, and
who had such appetites that I was almost worn out
with hunting things for them to eat, and was
obliged to get another Mrs. Paroquet to help me do
the work. Of course, I know about the North;
but pray go on and tell me how you happened to
be there, and why you are here again.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Red, “I’d like to tell some
body. You remember my old home up the river,
where the stream is so narrow that the boats almost
touch the shore as they pass. There’s a splendid
mass of yellow jasmine there, with lots of white
dogwood, and Cherokee roses, and orange-trees,
and palms, and magnolias, and water oaks, and
there I had my nest, all covered up with flowers
and leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was very happy in my soft, warm nest, with
Mr. Red, and four of the prettiest little birds you
ever saw just hatched and wanting a mother’s care
so badly. But one morning I saw coming down
the river one of those big boats, full of people, who
kept firing at the poor alligators sunning themselves
in the warm spring air. At last the boat
stopped, and some of the men got out and began to
look around and fire at anything they saw; and
one shot hit me under my wing, so that I could not
fly, but dropped to the ground, half dead with pain
and fright, but still having sense enough to be glad
that it was I who was hurt instead of Mr. Red, who
flew away to the top of the very tallest palm-tree in
sight, where he sat and watched while a man picked
me up and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘See, she is not dead; she is only wounded.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>I shall take her to my wife at the hotel. She has
wanted a Red-bird so much.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a hotel was, or where he meant to take
me, I did not know, and for a time I must have
been unconscious, for the next I knew I was on the
boat covered over with a kind of wire screen, which
kept me a prisoner. I could not get away, though
I beat my head against the screen until it ached
almost as hard as the place under my wing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! what a change it was from my lovely
nest among the oranges, and magnolias, and
jasmines, to that dreadful wooden box in which
they put me at the hotel, and which they called a
cage. I think my new mistress meant to be kind
to me, for she stroked my feathers very gently, and
called me a ‘poor little thing,’ and brought me so
many things to eat. But I could touch none of
them, I was so home-sick and lonely, and my heart
was aching so for the dear home up the river, and
the little birdies there, who were sure to cry for me
when the dark night came on and I was not there
to shelter them. Would Mr. Red do it? I wondered,
and I was afraid he wouldn’t; for, though
the very best of all the Red-birds on the St. John’s,
he did not always like to be bothered with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>children, especially when he was tired and a little
cross.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he did, though,” interrupted Mr. Paroquet.
“He took care of them for quite a while after you
went away. I used to see him hunting worms, and
seeds and things; and he’d go every day to the top
of that palm you spoke of, and watch to see if you
were not coming back. After awhile—well, you
remember old Mr. Red, whose nest was near yours
on a sour orange-tree, and whose pretty little
grand-daughter, Spotted-Wing, with the shining
feathers and so many airs, you did not fancy much?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I remember her,” Mrs. Red answered very
sadly, I thought, and Mr. Paroquet continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She used to fly up to that palm, too, and balance
herself way out on the very tip of the longest green
fan, and help him watch for <em>you</em>, because she was so
anxious for you to come back and relieve him of
his family cares, and then her eyes were younger
than his, and could see farther, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And as he said this Mr. Paroquet rolled both of
his eyes quite out of sight in what I thought a very
disagreeable, insinuating manner. But Mrs. Red
did not seem to notice, and went on with her story:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad if he was good to the children, and
missed me a little, for I was so home-sick for him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>that I could neither sleep nor eat, and I heard my
mistress say she was afraid I would starve to
death. And I was afraid, too, for had I been
disposed to eat I could not have touched what
she brought me—sweet potato, cake, and bread
and sugar, as if that were proper diet for a bird.
I had a great deal of attention from the guests
of the hotel. It was the St. James, I heard them
say, and it was full of people who did nothing but
eat, and sleep, and dress for the parlors or the
piazzas, where the young ones used to walk sometimes
of an evening. At last, one morning very
early, before anybody was up except a few of the
servants, I was sitting on my perch in a new cage,
with my head down, thinking so hard that I heard
nothing until suddenly I was startled by a strange
voice with a decidedly foreign accent, close to the
bars of my cage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Halloo, Miss Red-top,’ it said, ‘seems to me
you are down in the mouth this morning. Guess
you didn’t sleep well. What’s the matter with you?
Look up and speak to a fellow, can’t you?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I looked up and saw a big round fat robin,
with a breast red and shining, and a very good-natured
face, and eyes which were very curious and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>inquisitive, as if he meant to know everybody’s
business, and help them attend to it, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll bet that’s the very robin who brought me
news of my stuffed wife,” interposed Mr. Paroquet.
“He knows everybody, and can trace their family
back to the time when Mr. Noah let the first bird
out of the ark. He comes here every winter for
his health, he says, and he stops along by the way,
and so gets all the news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe it was the same,” Mrs. Red replied.
“But he was very kind to me, and asked me a great
many questions, and when he heard my story, he
said if it were not so warm he’d go up the river and
find Mr. Red, and tell him about me. I thanked
him and said that would do no good as I could not
get out of prison, and should die there very soon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘No, you won’t,’ he answered, cheerily. ‘You’ll
get used to it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, after eyeing me awhile, he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Why, Miss Red-top, I’ll tell you what’s the
matter. You are starved! Look at that sweet potato
and frosted cake. You’ll have dyspepsia sure.
What you want is a good fat bug, and seeds of some
kind. Just keep up your courage, and I’ll fix you.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“So saying, he flew away to a neighboring
garden, while I thought how good he was to me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>an entire stranger, though I did wish he would not
call me <em>miss</em>. It made me feel ashamed when I
remembered Mr. Red and the nest among the
jasmine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When my mistress came to see me, after breakfast,
bringing the usual sweet potato, and broiled
fish and bits of bread, she found a part of a bug in
my cage, and a piece of fig which my new friend
had found near one of the dining-room windows
and brought to me. Great was her wonder as to
where it came from, but as I could not talk to her,
though able to understand all she said, I do not
suppose she ever knew about the robin who came to
see me every morning before there was much stir
in the hotel, and kept me so well supplied with
such things as I liked, that I began to recover my
health and my spirits, too, though my heart was
always aching for the nest up the river, and the
babies I left in it. Gradually, too, I began to have
a great liking for Mr. Red-Breast, as I called him at
first, though he insisted that I should say Robin,
as that was more familiar. At home they all called
him Robin, and no one ever mistered him, he said,
except Mrs. Robin, when she began to help him
build the nest in the mountain ash, which he told
me grew in the garden where he lived at the North.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“One morning when he came to see me as
usual, complaining of the heat, and
saying he should soon be starting for
home if the weather continued like
this, he found me very sad and anxious, for only
the night before I had heard my mistress say that
she intended taking me North with her, and should,
perhaps, give me to a friend who had asked her to
bring her a bird from the South. This was a deathblow
to all my hopes, for as day after day I had
watched the piles of baggage and the crowds of
people which left the hotel, and heard the waiters
say they were starting for home, I thought to myself
the day will come when my mistress will go,
too, and then she will surely set me free, and I
fancied the surprise and joy of Mr. Red and the
little ones, when I flew down upon them some
evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About how long was this after your capture?”
asked the Paroquet, and Mrs. Red replied:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Three, or four, or five weeks. I don’t quite
remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” and Mr. Paroquet nodded very knowingly.
“I reckon he might have been surprised to
see you, and glad, of course, very glad, and Miss
Spotted-Wing, too, for she was at the jasmine nest
every day by that time, helping take care of the
children, and must have been pretty well tired out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and Mrs. Red spoke sorry-like, as she
always did when Spotted-Wing was mentioned, but
if she understood the Paroquet’s meaning she gave
no sign, and went on with her story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All my hopes were blasted now, for if my
mistress took me away with her that was the end
to my dream of freedom, and I was feeling so
wretched and heart-sick when Robin came, as usual,
and to him I told my trouble, asking what the
North was like, and if, as I had heard, it snowed
there all the time, though what snow was I did not
then know, any more than you knew what icicles
were when you asked if they grew on Christmas trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Snow all the time!’ and Robin laughed so
loudly that I was afraid he would awaken the lady
on whose window-sill he was sitting. ‘That is one
of your mistaken ideas of the North. Snow all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>time! No, nor half the time, though we do have
some pretty heavy north-easters when the wind
blows enough to shake your feathers off; but that
is in the winter, when such as you are in the warm
house, hanging by the windows, where you can look
out and see the snow drifting down through the
trees, as the leaves of the dogwood and Cherokee
roses fall in high wind. But it is the summer that
is just glorious up there! Do you see that patch
of green?’ and he nodded toward a yard not far
away, which I had before noticed, and thought very
fine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Well, the people who live there have sowed
some kind of grain to make believe it was grass,
but, dear me, it is no more like the turf at the
North than your sand is like our clay. I wish you
could see our beautiful lawns and meadows; they
are just like a piece of green velvet. There is grass
everywhere, and such flowers as we have in the
summer time; such roses! No Cherokees, to be
sure, but all the other kinds, with names I cannot
begin to pronounce. And there is some smell to
the lilacs, and honeysuckles, and the June pinks,
and the English violets, and I can’t begin to tell you
what else, except that the beds and borders are one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>blaze of beauty and brightness from early June till
the frost comes in the fall.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Do you have magnolias there?’ I asked, and
he answered slowly, ‘Well, now, Miss Red, we
don’t have magnolias, nor orange blossoms, nor
jasmines, and such like, but we have pond lilies,
which to my mind beat everything else in the
world. I wish you could see my home, or rather
the garden where I was born, and have lived all
my life. It is so lovely, with its grass and evergreens,
and mountain ash and horse-chestnuts, and
so many crooked little paths winding here and
there, and arbors covered with woodbine, and
grape-vines, and roses, and in the summer so many
baskets and tall white things filled with flowers;
and, oh my, if you could just see the cherry-trees!
It makes my mouth water now to think of the
luscious fruit of which we robins can have all we
want. There is one tree which my mistress says
belongs to the boys and birds, and such squabbles
as we have over it. I don’t much like the boys, for
they will leave cherries any time to break up a
bird’s nest, and I’ve seen some sad sights in my
time; though in the garden everything was peaceful
and quiet, for my mistress takes care of the birds,
and sometimes in spring, when the snow comes late,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and we cannot find any worms, she gives us bread
crumbs to eat, and we are not afraid of her, though
she comes very near to us. My nest was up under
the eaves, and near a chamber window, where I felt
so safe and secure, knowing that nothing could ever
touch the pretty blue eggs which Mrs. Robin laid
every spring and summer. Neither boy nor cat
could reach us there.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Cat?’” I said. “‘Cat! Pray what is that?
I never heard of a cat before.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Never heard of a cat?’ Mr. Robin repeated,
and now he laughed so loudly that the lady in the
room upon whose window-sill he was sitting turned
the shutter, and looked out to see what all the
chattering was about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Seems to me the birds make a great noise
this morning. They have been at it more than an
hour,’ I heard her say, and then she went on with
her dressing, while Robin continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Never heard of a cat! Why, where were you
raised, that your education was so neglected? But
I forgot that you Red-birds lead a kind of Bohemian
life apart from civilization, and so fail to
learn a great many things which we robins, who are
in society all the time, take naturally.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had before observed that Mr. Robin, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>given to a good deal of slang, sometimes went off
into strains which I could not understand, and this
was one of them, for I had not the remotest idea
what he meant by civilization or Bohemian either,
and I said so to him, whereupon he laughed again,
and told me that the free and easy life I led up the
river with Mr. Red and the little Reds, and the
jasmines, and Cherokees, and alligators was Bohemian,
while it was the very top of civilization
and society to be shut up in a gilded cage as I was,
with no chance of escape. At the risk of seeming
very vulgar and ignorant in his eyes, I told him I
liked Bohemian best, even if I had never heard of a
cat, and then I questioned him again of that creature,
was it a bird, or a beast, or what?’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘A <em>beast</em> most decidedly,’ he said; ‘a <em>vile, ugly
beast</em>,’ and by ugly he meant bad, for he said cats
looked well enough, and he had even heard his
mistress call one she had ‘a darling little beauty,’
but he did not see it. They had fur instead of
feathers, four legs instead of two, with a long
streamer behind which was called a tail, and which
was anything but handsome. Then they were the
natural enemies of birds, which they caught and ate
whenever a chance occurred.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“‘Eat birds! Eat my little Reds!’ I exclaimed,
in horror, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Yes, quicker than wink if they could get at ’em;
and they are so sly and creeping-like that they are
upon you before you know it, and they keep us in
a constant fret when we are teaching our young
ones to fly.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Then there is something bad even at the
North, which you describe as so perfect,’ I said, a
little maliciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Why, yes,’ he answered, slightly crestfallen.
‘We have cats there, but then there’s no place just
exactly right, you know. There’s a <em>cat</em> or something
everywhere.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew that ‘by cat or something,’ he meant
an annoyance of some kind, and I thought of the
yellow jasmines up the river, and said to myself,
‘There’s no cat there;’ and then, when I remembered
how Mr. Red had sometimes troubled me
with his indolent habits, and his familiar way of
talking to that pert Miss Spotted-Wing, I thought
that might perhaps have been a cat, or at least a
kitten, as Robin said the little cats were called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then he told me of a kitten which came to
his mistress’ door one wintry day when the snow
was blowing, as he said, great guns, and the mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>ash almost bent up double before the driving
wind. His mistress heard the cry, and saw the kitty
looking in at the window and begging to come in;
and as both she and the master were fond of cats
he waded out into the snow and brought the kitty
in, and gave it milk in a china saucer in the parlor,
and petted it more than they did old Fanny, a highly
respectable cat, who had lived with them a long
time, and who did not at first take kindly to <em>Jim</em>—that
was what they called the intruder—but spit at
him, and boxed his ears, and growled if he came
near her. But Jim was not to be repressed, and
cared nothing for Fanny’s growls, or spits, or
boxes, but seized every opportunity to jump at her
from under chairs and tables, and to spring at her
tail, until the old cat’s life was almost a burden to
her. At last, however, Jim conquered, and the two
were the best of friends, Fanny treating him as if he
had been her own, giving him more than half the
milk, and even waking him up when the dinner-bell
rang, if he happened to be sleeping in the easy-chair
near the fire, where he took his usual nap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘After a time,’ said Robin, ‘old Fanny died,
and was buried in the garden, under the plum-tree,
and then Jim was really the master of the house, for
I never knew a cat petted as my mistress petted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>him. And for a cat he was very handsome. He
did not grow tall and long, as cats usually do, but
was short, and fat, and round as a ball, with fur
which shone like satin, and a white spot under his
chin. I did not wonder my mistress liked him, he
was so playful and affectionate; but it used to make
me sick sometimes when she actually kissed him
and called him a darling. But when one morning
he caught a little striped snake, and carried it to her
in triumph, and persisted in keeping it and tossing
it in the air in spite of all her efforts to make him
drop it, I noticed that she did not fondle him for a
week; and I think she put him in the bath-tub, for
I saw him lying in the sun, looking very wet and
forlorn. But his fur was soon dried, and he raced
about the grounds like a mad creature, catching
grasshoppers and flies, and worrying almost to
death a highly respectable toad, who lived near the
cellar door, outside.’</p>

“All this time I had felt no fears for the
pretty blue eggs in our nest under the
eaves, and with Mrs. Robin I was very
happy watching them until the shells
cracked open and four little birds appeared. They
were our first, and we were so proud and fond of
them, and nursed them with so much care, until one
beautiful summer morning when we thought them
old enough to begin to learn to fly. I shall never
forget that day, and it all comes back to me now so
vividly, the bright sunshine, the shadows on the
grass, the ripe cherries on the trees, and our little
ones hopping about on the walks, and then flying a
few feet. I had taken the precaution to see that
Jim was asleep in his chair, and so had no fear of
him. Three of our children were sitting on the
branch of a tree; but the fourth, who had never
seemed quite as bright as the others, and whom we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>called Stupid, was in the grass pecking away at a
cherry, while I was hunting about for more, when
suddenly Mrs. Robin gave a terrible scream, and
darted past me so swiftly that I felt kind of dizzy
like and frightened, and flew up into a honeysuckle,
where I was out of danger, and could look around
and see what Mrs. Robin was so excited about. I
never thought of Stupid, and my blood curdled in
my veins, and I went a little higher up in the honeysuckle,
when I saw that Jim had him in his mouth,
and was bounding through the grounds with Mrs.
Robin in hot pursuit, uttering such dreadful cries
that out came my mistress with her parasol, and the
cook with the broom, and the housemaid with the
duster, and all took after Jim, on whose back Mrs.
Robin finally pounced, pecking him so with her
beak that he dropped his victim and turned to
defend himself. But it was too late; poor little
Stupid was dead, and that night there were only
three little birds in our nest, and Mrs. Robin never
spoke to me but once, and that was to call me a
coward for hiding in the honeysuckle, instead of
fighting as she did. If there was anything she despised,
it was a <em>sneak</em>, she said, and for a whole
week she was very cool and distant toward me, and
would not believe me at all when I told her how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>sorry I was for my apparent want of courage, and
that I stood back to look after our other young
ones, and see that no harm came to them, while
she, and my mistress, and the cook and the housemaid
did battle with Jim.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘That was our first quarrel and our first
sorrow, and I may say our last, for before we
had any more eggs in our nest the horrid Jim
was dead. Just what ailed him I never knew,
but Mrs. Robin said he had been fed too high,
and possibly she was right. At any rate he grew
very thin, and sick, and weak, and we watched him
anxiously, feeling glad to see him suffer when we
remembered Stupid, but sorry for our mistress, who
nursed him so carefully, and cried that morning
when they found him dead on the grass, with the
rain falling heavily upon him. They buried him
under the plum-tree, by the side of Fanny; and
there’s not even a kitten about the house now, for
they made such work with the lace curtains, jumping
at each other through them, and scratched up
the flower-beds so, that my mistress grew tired of
them, and there’s nothing in that garden to trouble
us birds. But our nest is not now up under the
eaves, for they have torn the house down over our
heads two or three times, and our home is in a big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>horse-chestnut, where the leaves are so thick that
not a boy in the neighborhood has ever suspected
where we live.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here the robin stopped to rest, for he had
talked so fast, and used so many large words, that
he was quite out of breath; and as by that time the
people began to come out on the piazza for the
fresh morning air, he flew away to a live-oak-tree,
and began to sing merrily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the Red-bird paused, and from my seat
beneath the magnolia I looked at the Paroquet just
in time to detect him trying to hide a yawn, as if he
were slightly tired with Robin, and Stupid, and
Jim, and cats generally. But perhaps I was mistaken,
for after a moment he asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Mrs. Robin now? Do you know if
she is dead or alive?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dead,” answered the Red-bird. “Robin told
me that she was with him two winters ago, near
Tallahassee, and that they built a nest there—almost
the first in Florida, for as a general thing robins do
not nest here; but they did, and were very happy,
too, until poor Mrs. Robin was killed—shot by one
of the soldiers who used to be so thick in those
parts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s the same fellow I know,” returned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Paroquet, “a great gossip; but go on—you certainly
have more to tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, a great deal more,” said Mrs. Red;
“but my story takes me now to the North, for my
mistress left Florida a few days after my long talk
with Robin; and after a three days’ voyage by sea,
during which I was so sick that I hoped I should
die, we reached a place they called New York, and
there I changed owners. It seems my mistress
lived very far to the West, and as she had found it
some trouble to travel with me, she gave me to a
friend of hers whom she met at the hotel, and who
took even better care of me than she had done, for
sometimes she had forgotten to give me any water
for an entire day, and had otherwise neglected me.
But my new mistress was very kind, and petted me
a great deal, and called me some of the names
Robin had said his mistress gave to her cat Jim.
I missed Robin, and wondered if I should ever see
him again. It was not likely, I thought, for of
course his home and mine must be miles apart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were going home very soon, I heard my
mistress say, and one morning we left the noisy city,
and when we stopped it was so late and so dark that
I could not see where we were, or what the house
was like. It was very quiet and still, and I was so
tired and worn with the journey that I slept soundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>until morning, and was only awakened by the
housemaid when she came to open the shutters.
It was a funny kind of a house, unlike anything I
had ever seen before, which was not strange, perhaps,
inasmuch as I had only been in big hotels.
Still I think it was different from most houses, for
the rooms all opened into each other, with no doors
to shut, if one had wished to shut them; and there
were queer nooks and corners, everywhere, and
pleasant places to sit, and read the books upon the
shelves. I really began to feel quite literary and
learned myself, there were so many books, and
pictures, and curious things from foreign parts, the
names of which I did not then know, but I learned
these afterward from hearing the people, who came
to see my mistress, talk about them. There were
Madonnas, and saints, and angels from Florence,
and Rome, and Dresden, and dancing girls from
Pompeii, and Apollos, and Venuses, and vases, and
shells, and tables, and more things than I can remember
now. I think my mistress wrote books,
for there used often to be ink spots on her fingers,
and a very tired look on her face when she came
from a room upstairs which they called the library,
and where she spent most of her mornings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must have been April when I went to my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>new home, and one morning I saw what a snow-storm
was for the first time in my life. My cage
was hung in such a pretty little nook off from a
bay window where a great many flowers were kept,
and there were windows on three sides, so that I
could look out into the yard, and see the big snowflakes
sifting down through the trees, until the
ground was completely covered with a soft carpet
of white, and the little birds which had been flitting
about for several days, hid themselves in the evergreens,
and I heard my mistress say she must throw
them some crumbs if the weather continued so cold.
And that made me think of Mr. Robin, and what
he had told me of his mistress feeding the birds.
Where was he, I wondered, and where was his
home, and I wished so much that I might see him
again, if only to ask if there was any news from the
South, where I left all that made life pleasant to me.
I was always thinking of the old home among the
jasmines, and it was especially kept in my mind by
a stuffed bird which hung on a shelf in one corner
of the nook where my cage was hung. My mistress
brought it and put it there one morning, and said
to me very friendly-like: ‘There, little Reddy, that
will remind you of home, and who knows but poor
Greenie came from the same place with yourself?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>It was a Paroquet, with such lovely green and golden
feathers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With a brownish tinge on the breast?” Mr.
Paroquet asked, somewhat anxiously, and Mrs. Red
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I noticed that particularly—the mottled
appearance of the breast, where there was a spot of
bright yellow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My first wife, I’ll wager my head!” exclaimed
Mr. Paroquet, very much awake now, and excited,
it seemed to me, for he flew from the magnolia,
where he had been sitting in a sleepy kind of way,
to the orange-tree, where he alighted close to
Mrs. Red, and continued: “My wife, from your
description; the one they carried away and stuffed,
so Robin said. Do you think she <em>was</em> stuffed—think
she was really dead, or will she be coming
back some day when I don’t expect her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dead? Of course she was dead,” returned
Mrs. Red, rather scornfully. “She never spoke
nor moved, all the time I was there, but just stared
at me with those dreadful glass eyes, which made
me feel so uncomfortable. You need have no fears
of her coming back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well,” returned Mr. Paroquet, brightening
up a little. “Not that I shouldn’t be very glad to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>see her; very glad, of course, but then, you see,
there’s the present Mrs. Paroquet, who might not
be so glad, and that would make it rather awkward.
Nobody can be dead a year, and come back, without
being a very little in the way, for they are sure to
find their places filled, or at least bridged over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To me, who, you will remember, was sitting on
a bench listening to the conversation of these birds,
the Paroquet’s assertion was startling, and for a few
moments I forgot what the birds were saying, while
I asked myself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it true that if I were to die, and go away into
the darkness and silence of the grave, and then after
a year could come back to the friends who had wept
so bitterly when I left them, is it true that I should
find myself in the way—my place filled, or bridged
over with new loves and interests, which my sudden
return would disturb and mar?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then I thought of a little blue-eyed, golden-haired
girl, whom we called Nellie, and whose grave
had been on the hill-side more than a dozen years.
If she could come back again, would she not find
a warm welcome from the mother who never mentions
her without the hot tears springing to her
eyes! Would Nellie be in the way? Oh, no, not
the <em>little</em> Nellie who died that winter day so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>years ago, the child Nellie, whose chair is in the
corner yet, and whose picture looks down upon us
from the wall. <em>She</em> could never be in the way,
though the <em>woman</em>, the Nellie of twenty years, might
be strange at first to the mother twelve years older
now, with fuller and larger experiences of life, and
habits of making plans with Nellie left out of them;
but there could be no real jarring of new loves and
interests; there could only be a deep joy and
thankfulness for the Nellie alive again. So I
reasoned—so I decided, and then turned back to the
birds, who were still at their talk, and had passed
from the snow-storm of April to the month of May,
when Mrs. Red’s cage was first hung in a mountain
ash which grew in the garden of her new home.</p>

“The day was so bright,” she said, “and
the grass so green, and the yard so
beautiful, that for a time I could only
look around me and admire the many
pretty things scattered about the grounds. And as
I looked it seemed to me I must have been there
before, everything was so familiar, even to the iron
deer with Southern moss upon his horns. Had I
dreamed of all this, or what was it? I asked, and
my head was beginning to ache with trying to recall
something in the past, when suddenly a voice, which
I remembered perfectly, called out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Halloo, Miss Red, if this don’t beat all. Here
you are away up here on my own ground. How
did it happen? And what do you think of the
North now?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was Robin, of course, and to my great delight
I found that I was actually in the very garden he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>described to me, that my mistress was his mistress,
and that his nest was up in one of the tall horse
chestnuts, which grew at the entrance of the
grounds. And there was another Mrs. Robin now,
a pretty little bird, who arched her neck so gracefully
and looked so shyly at me from her bright
eyes when Robin brought and introduced her to
me. They were very happy together—Mr. and
Mrs. Robin—and I in part forgot my own sorrows
and loneliness in watching them day by day as they
flew in and out of the nice soft nest in the chestnut tree,
and made wide circles in the air just as I used
to do away down on the river.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last Robin came to me with a very important
air, and told me there were four blue eggs in
the nest, and Mrs. Robin was sitting on them to
keep them warm, and he was going to hunt worms
for her from the mound of earth just turned up in
the garden. They were Mrs. Robin’s first eggs,
and she scarcely left them at all until the shells
were broken and I heard there were four young
birds in the nest. Oh, how proud little Mrs. Robin
was! What care she took of her babies—more care,
indeed, than Robin, who was growing old and fat,
and indisposed for work, and who sometimes called
her nervous and fussy, and told her that nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>could harm her children as long as they staid up in
that tall tree. Still Mrs. Robin was very watchful
and vigilant, and looked askance at every boy who
passed on the walk, and even at Harry and Grey
and Gifford, little boys who came sometimes to play
in the garden, and who could no more have climbed
to the nest than they could have gone to the steeple
of the church just showing above the trees in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last, when the birds were old enough to be
taught to fly, an event occurred which threw Mrs.
Robin into a wild state of excitement. I had
several times heard my mistress and the cook talking
together of some people who were coming to
spend a portion of the summer, and I had caught
the names of Florence and Johnnie, but who
Florence and Johnnie were I did not know or particularly
care, for it mattered little to me who came
or went. I was never molested, and my daily wants
were supplied with great regularity. And still I
did have some little curiosity with regard to the
expected guests, on whose account the whole household
was, for a few days, in an unusual commotion.
On the afternoon when they arrived my cage was
hanging in a little archway at the rear of the
grounds, and so I heard and saw nothing until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Robin, who had been absent for a few hours, came
home, and stopped for a moment on a shrub near
me to rest and chat awhile, as he was in the habit
of doing. In fact, I had sometimes thought that
Mrs. Robin, whom, since the birth of the birds, he
had called little Motherdy, while she in return had
called him Fatherdy, was more than half jealous of
me because of Robin’s sociability. At all events he
never sat near me long before she joined him and
made some excuse to get him away. So I was not
surprised to see her flying toward us from the
cherry-tree, where she had been pecking away at a
half-ripe cherry. As she came near I saw at a
glance that something was the matter, and so did
Robin, and he called out in his cheery, teasing way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Well, little Motherdy, what’s up now, that
your feathers seem so ruffled, and you so excited?
Anything happened to the young ones, or what is
the matter?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Matter!’ she repeated. ‘Matter enough.
What do you think has come right into our midst
to worry our birds to death?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Cats, maybe,’ he said; and she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Cats! No, something worse than that. Two
children, boy and girl, and by the looks of the
luggage they have come to stay, and there’s an end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of all peace for us. Why, the boy has already spied
me, and actually thought he could reach me, and I
on the top of the Brockway house. You would far
better have put our nest in the evergreens across the
street, where I wanted it. But no, you must stay in
that old place just because you used to live there
with the other one, who I wish was here now. Such
a time as I am going to have with those children!
Afraid for my life and the babies every minute!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had known before that Motherdy, though a
nice little thing, had a temper, and that she was
sometimes given to being jealous of the first Mrs.
Robin, and that she had opposed the old nest in the
chestnut tree, because Mrs. Robin 1st had lived
there. But she was so pretty, and had such graceful
ways, that Robin never lost his temper, no
matter how unreasonable she might be, and now he
only laughed good-humoredly and made light of
her fears, saying his mistress would never allow
any one to disturb the birds, and as for the evergreens
across the street, where she had wanted him
to build a new nest, she would have been no safer
there, for was not Harry over there, and Grey, and
were they not both larger than this Chicago boy
who had so alarmed her?</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You are nervous, little Motherdy,’ he said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>‘You have <em>boy</em> on the brain. Hadn’t you better go
home? Some boy may have stolen your babies,
nest and all.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Motherdy was too angry to reply, and flew
away rapidly, followed soon by Robin, who, I suppose,
made his peace with her, for they were out
together early the next morning, hunting for worms
and grasshoppers, and talking lovingly in the
language which birds understand. And still I
could see that both were rather anxious for the appearance
of the children, Florence and Johnnie,
and so was I, for I had heard the sound of voices
from the house—sweet, musical voices, such as
children always have—and I thought I could tell
which was Florence and which was Johnnie, for
one I knew was two or three years older than the
other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At last they came into the grounds with a laugh
and a bound, and from the ridge-pole of the Brockway
house Fatherdy and Motherdy were watching
them, while I, in my cage, looked eagerly and curiously
at them. How pretty they were in their white
dresses and gay sashes—Florence with her pale face
and starry eyes of black, which seemed to see everything
at once, and Johnnie with his great round
blue eyes, the color of the robin’s eggs, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>beautiful golden hair falling in curls about his
neck. ‘Black-Eyes’ and ‘Bright-Hair’ I named
them at once, and I watched them as they started to
run up the gravel walk. Bright-Hair, whose little
feet had just commenced to walk, fell down, of
course, and bumped his nose and soiled his clean
white dress; but he did not seem to mind it at all,
but, man-like, got up again and started after Black-Eyes,
who had spied a little arbor under an apple-tree,
which she decided was just the place for the
mud pies she was longing to make, as no child’s
life in the country is complete without a trial of
making and baking pies. Then she saw me next,
and both came rushing to me, and Bright-Hair
wanted to ‘take, take,’ and stretched his little hands
toward me, and tried to climb the lattice, in the
archway of which I was hanging. But I was far
above his reach, and looked down upon him fearlessly
as he tried in vain to get me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What lovely children they were, and those were
very happy days when I watched them flitting about
the grounds or making their mud pies in the grapevine
arbor. I think the cook must have been very
good-natured, for she gave up her muffin-rings, and
sponge-cake tins, and iron spoons, and a pan and
dipper for the bakery, and even brought a box of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>dirt, which little Florence called flour; and then
the mud pie business began in earnest, and Johnnie’s
fat white arms were besmeared above his elbows,
and his face was covered with mud, and Florence
was not much better, as in her long-sleeved gingham
apron she worked industriously at her pies and
cakes, which were made into wonderful shapes, and
baked on a griddle in the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometimes Maggie and Harry, and Grey and
Sophie and Louise came to help, but the girls were
almost too old for mud pies, and Grey was afraid of
soiling his clothes, and Harry fonder of chasing a
kitten which had strayed into the yard the day after
the children came, and which my mistress kept as a
plaything for them, and so Black-Eyes and Bright-Hair
had the pies mostly to themselves. It was difficult
to tell which Bright-Hair liked the best—the pies
or the kitten, which he called the ‘<em>cart</em>,’ or the little
robins, which were just learning to fly, and who hopped
about in a very stupid way, while little Motherdy
watched narrowly and nervously to see that no harm
came to them, either from the cat, or Bright-Hair,
who always started for them when he saw them
in the grass, and seemed greatly disturbed because
they flew away just before he had reached them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One afternoon there was a garden party for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>children, and I think I never saw a finer sight than
it was to see all those little girls and boys in their
best clothes, which did not look quite so fresh and
nice when they went home, as when they came. Oh,
what fine times they had playing upon the lawn,
and in the different arbors, which were fitted up
with dollies, furniture, and called by different
names. There was the ‘Doll’s Drawing-room,’
where the larger dolls sat solemn and still in their
chairs, and there was a sleeping room for the dolls,
and Apple-Tree Hotel and a restaurant near by,
where the children had macaroons, and took weak
lemonade through straws; but the thing which
pleased them most was the wheel chair, in which all
the children had a ride before the day was done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That afternoon, Motherdy kept her robins out
of sight, and did not allow them once to fly down
into the grass, lest some harm should befall them.
She was not afraid of Bright-Hair nor Black-Eyes,
nor Harry, nor Grey, nor Maggie, nor Gifford, she
said, but she distrusted some of the larger boys, who
ran so fast and made so much noise, and she kept
her children at home greatly against their will.
They were not afraid, and I think had really
become attached to Black-Eyes and Bright-Hair,
and so had the Fatherdy and Motherdy birds, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>liked to see them round, and thought the grounds
were prettier because they were there. I thought
so, too, and when at last their father came and took
them away, I felt more lonely and desolate than
I had done in weeks, while my friends, Mr. and
Mrs. Robin, with their four young ones, flew up to
the ridge-pole of the house, and watched the huge
thing which bore them away until it was out of
sight, and there was nothing to be seen but a ring
of smoke away to the west, where they were gone.
I remember that my mistress came out to the arbor
where the children had played, and cried a little as
she picked up the spoons, and plates and dishes
which had been used for their mud pies, some of
which were still baking in the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I pass rapidly over the remainder of the
summer and the fall, when Mr. and Mrs. Robin
bade me good-by, and, with their family started for
the South. How I longed to go with them, and
how many messages I sent to Mr. Red and my own
little ones, should they chance to meet them. And
then the days were very long and dreary, until
little Florence came again to pass the holidays with
her auntie, and there was a Christmas-tree in the
church, and I was taken there in my cage and hung
near the chancel, where I could see all the fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>doings which were so new and strange to me. But
I soon began to understand it, and watched the
ladies with a great deal of interest as they filled the
tree with every conceivable toy for the children,
who, when it was done, came crowding in, and
filled nearly half the church. What carols they
sang of the ‘Wonderful Night,’and ‘Jesus of
Bethlehem,’ and how the organ filled the church
and even made the floor tremble, as the organist
played with both hands and feet, and the children’s
voices rose louder and clearer as they sang of a
Saviour’s birth. I really began to feel quite like a
churchman myself, or at least like a church bird,
though I <em>did</em> wonder why I was there. But I soon
found out, for as name after name was called, and
the children came trooping up to receive their gifts,
I heard at last little Florence called, and, to my
surprise, I was given to her as a Christmas gift from
her auntie. I knew that she was very fond of me,
and called me a great many pet names, and gave me
more things to eat than I could possibly take, but
I had never dreamed of belonging to her, and when
I found that I was to go with her to her home in
Chicago, where Bright-Hair lived, I felt at first
sorry to leave my former mistress, who had been
so kind to me. And there was Robin, whom I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>might never see again, and the beautiful garden
where I had spent so many pleasant days. But it
could not be helped, and within a week or two I
was hanging in a bay window in my new home in
the city, and I was very happy there, too, with
Black-Eyes and Bright-Hair for my companions.
Children do cheer up a house wonderfully, and I
learned to listen to their merry voices, and wait
anxiously for their appearance in the morning.
As the winter wore away and the spring came on,
little Florence, who was always a pale, delicate
child, seemed to grow paler and thinner every day,
until at last she refused to eat anything, and in the
summer they took us all to their country home, a
few miles from the city, where she improved
rapidly, and ran about the grounds as merrily as
ever. But when the autumn came and the winds
blew cold from the lake, she began to droop again,
and I heard them say they must take her South,
where it was always warm and sunny.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then my heart began to beat so fast with
wondering if she would take me with her. I half
believed she would, she loved me so much—and she
did, and we came to the same hotel where I was first
a prisoner, and my cage was hung again in the old
place, where through the trees of oak and orange I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>could see glimpses of the river, and the boats as
they went up and down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really, now, it is all quite like a story. Have
you seen Robin? and how did you get away?” Mr.
Paroquet said, hopping up and down, first on one
foot and then on the other, as if he were growing
tired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Red noticed this, and hastened on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I have seen Robin; it was up the river,
where he is spending the winter with Mrs. Robin,
who is as bright, and pretty, and spirited as ever—but
I must tell you how I came to be up the river
myself. My dear little mistress, Florence, knew
that my home was once in this part of the country,
and a few days ago, when she gave me my breakfast
of seeds and figs, she talked to me in her usual
loving way, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You know my mamma says I am not getting
well here as fast as I ought, and she is going to take
me to St. Augustine, down by the sea, and so, poor
little Reddie, I love you ever and ever so much, but
I’ve been thinking and thinking how dreadful it
would be for me to be shut up as you are, and taken
away where I never could see my papa, or mamma,
or Johnnie any more. Maybe, though, you haven’t
a papa, or mamma, or Johnnie. I guess birds never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>have such things, like us girls, but you may have
had some little birds in some nest somewhere, and
maybe you can find your way home to that nest, and
so, you precious old Reddie, I am going to make
you a present of your freedom. I am going to open
the door of your cage, and let you go—so!’</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here she opened the door suddenly, and
gave the cage a shake which sent me out upon the
piazza.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I had stopped a minute to consider, I might
have hesitated about leaving the cage which had been
my home so long, and to which I was really very
much attached, but just as I hopped out upon the
floor, some children came running round the corner
and frightened me so, that I instantly flew to the top
of a tree near by. It was my first experiment in flying
for almost two years, and it seemed so natural,
so delightful, to beat the air with my wings once
more, and freedom seemed so sweet that I could not
go back, but sat for a moment looking at the empty
cage and my little mistress standing by it with a
sorry look on her face, as if she had not quite expected
me to leave her so readily. Then I thought
of the nest in the jasmine, and of Mr. Red, and the
happy life I had lived with him among the orange-trees
and magnolias, and I said to myself, ‘I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>go there,’ and while my mistress was looking up at
me with those bright black eyes of hers, I flew away
as fast as my wings could take me, in the direction
of my old home. But not being accustomed to flying,
I soon grew tired, and stopped many times to
rest and look down from some tall tree upon the
river, which had never seemed so beautiful to me as
it did that day.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“It was late in the afternoon when I
reached the clump of jasmine where I
had left my little ones, and though
I knew that by this time they were
grown-up birds, and possibly had families of their
own, I could not help feeling as if I should find
them just as I had left them, hungry, noisy, and so
glad to see me. It was very still in the thicket, and
not a single bird of any kind was to be seen. But
this did not surprise me much, for it was the time
of day when the old birds would naturally be off
after the little ones’ supper. They would soon be
coming back, and I thought how delighted Mr. Red
would be, and how startled, too, when he found me
waiting for him just as I used to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I reckon he was startled, too,” interrupted the
Paroquet. “But pray hurry on. I <em>was</em> getting a
little tired, but I’m all attention now. You waited,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>you say, for Mr. Red to come, and didn’t you go
near the old nest till he came?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Red, “I went to the nest
the first thing, and found it just as I had seen it in
my dreams so many times, and right at the bottom,
huddled together, were three little ones about the
size of mine when I left them. And for an instant
I forgot myself and thought they <em>were</em> mine, and
flew down so close to them that they awoke and
began to scramble toward the top of the nest and
open their mouths as if they were hungry. On the
right wing of two of them little brown spots were
beginning to show, and then I <em>knew</em>, and grew sick
and faint, and more sorry than I had been since the
day I was stolen away, and with such a different
kind of sorrow, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Always before in the midst of my sharpest pain
there had been a kind of comfort in thinking that
Mr. Red remembered and longed for me just as I
longed for and remembered him, but now I knew
better. Those birds in the nest were not my birds.
Spotted-Wing was their mother. I was forgotten;
my place was filled; nobody wanted me there, and
I felt as if my throat would burst with the lump
which kept rising in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And while I waited, sitting high above the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>nest where I could look down into it, there was a
whiz and whir in the air, and Spotted-Wing came
home, looking a little older than when I saw her
last, but quite as pretty and very happy. I was
obliged to own that to myself, as I sat and watched
her feeding her young ones, and every now and
then turning up her head as if listening for some
one. Just so I used to listen and just so I used to
act when Mr. Red was coming home, as he did at
last, and Spotted-Wing flew out a little way to
meet him, and rubbed her bill against his, and
kept at his side as he flew so near to me that the air
set in motion by his wings stirred my feathers, and I
could have touched him had I tried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, little did he dream who it was that sat and
watched him until it grew dark, and all was still in
the dear old nest which was once my home. When
I could no longer see him and knew that he was
asleep, I said good-by to him forever, and flew
away to the palm-tree; where I staid till morning,
and then I started down the river, caring nothing
where I went or what became of me, and feeling an
indescribable longing for the cage I had quitted
and the little mistress I had left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was then that I came suddenly upon Robin,
who is living near Green Cove Spring, and who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>was both astonished and delighted to see me. My
face must have told him that I knew the worst, for
he only said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Poor little Reddie, it is rather hard, but it’s
the way of the world. I s’pose you didn’t see your
own children. One of them is dead, and the others
are far up the river, near Enterprise, with families
of their own, and as likely birds as you could wish
to see. They think you dead, and so does Mr. Red,
of course.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both Robin and Motherdy were very kind to
me, and I staid with them all that day and night,
and they brought me my supper and tried to cheer
me up, but nothing can ever make me happy again
unless it be to find myself in the cage once more,
with Florence and Johnnie to pet me. But even
that pleasure is denied me, for when I left Robin I
went back to Jacksonville and the hotel, hoping to
find my mistress. But she had gone down by the
sea, and it is a long way there, and I might get lost,
and not find her after all, so I have given it up, and
what I shall do with myself now I am sure I don’t
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do?” repeated the Paroquet, who began to
evince a friendliness I had not given him credit for.
“Why, make the best of it, of course, and if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>are so anxious to find Black-Eyes and Bright-Hair
again, go over to St. Augustine after them. It is
not so very far: I’ve been there. I know the way.
I’ll go with you and start now, to-day, if you like.
It’s up the river a ways, and then across the wildest,
swampiest piece of country you ever saw. But St.
Augustine is lovely—some like that North you are
so delighted with, and maybe you will make up your
mind to stay there if you do not find the children.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I almost know I shall not,” returned Mrs.
Red, who seemed to be quite discouraged, “for how
shall I know where to look for them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look! Why, look everywhere, at all the hotels
and boarding-houses, but mostly at the Old Fort
and in a square they call the Plaza. Children all
like to play there. We shall find them, don’t you
fear, so come; it is getting almost noon, and we
ought to be off. We will fly across the river first,
and then hunt a bug or two for dinner, before we
start again, so here goes.” And spreading his
beautiful green wings, the Paroquet flew swiftly
away, followed by Mrs. Red, who moved more
slowly, for she was tired, and had not much heart
or courage left.</p>

<p class='c011'>I was half afraid she would drop into the water,
but the Paroquet evidently encouraged her to exert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>herself as much as possible, and at last I was glad
to see that they were fairly over the river, and resting
on a live-oak tree. Then I started as from a
dream, and wondered if it were really true that I
had heard birds talk together, and if poor Reddie
would ever find Florence and Johnnie again, and
be happy once more. I hoped she would, and that
I might know it; and I did, for when the spring
came, and, with many other travelers, I started for
home on the <em>City of Savannah</em>, I noticed upon the
boat two lovely children, a boy and girl, one with
beautiful black eyes, and the other with eyes as blue
as the April sky over our heads. <em>Fornce</em> the little
boy called his sister, and then I guessed at once I
had found Black-Eyes and Bright-Hair, and remembering
Mrs. Red I said to the little girl one day:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t your name Florence and your brother’s
name Johnnie, and don’t you live in Chicago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes,” she answered, looking curiously at
me. “How did you know that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I guessed it,” I said, and then I added:
“Did you ever have a Red-bird in a cage, which you
let go one morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” she replied; “but I think I have her again.
I’m almost sure of it. She is in my stateroom.
Don’t you want to see her?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Of course I wanted to see her, though as Red-birds
are much alike, I knew I could not tell if this
were the one whose sad story I had heard on
Christmas morning. But when Florence told me
the particulars of its recapture I was sure of it, and
rejoiced that poor little Reddie was happy with
its friends, Florence and Johnnie. They were at
the Old Fort in St. Augustine one morning,
Florence said, and one of the Indians kept as
prisoners there, was teaching her how to use the
bow and arrow, while Johnnie stood by begging to
“<em>soot too</em>,” when suddenly a Red-bird, which seemed
to be very tired, flew down at her feet, and kept
hopping around close to her, while Johnnie tried to
catch it, and the young Indian suggested making it
a mark to shoot at. But from this Florence recoiled
in horror, and, stooping toward the bird,
she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe it’s my very own dear old birdie I
used to have in a cage. Are you mine, Reddie?”
and she held her hands toward it, when Reddie flew
up to her shoulder, and caressed her face, and neck,
and hair with its bill, nestling close to her, as if it
did not wish to be let go again.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Florence took her back to the hotel where
she was stopping, and, bringing out the cage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>opened the door and set it before Reddie, who
instantly went into it, and springing up to the
perch, began to swing back and forth as if perfectly
delighted with its quarters; nor could it be tempted
to come out of the cage, although the door was left
open the entire day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I knew for sure it was mine,” Florence
said, “and that it wanted to come and live with me
again; though it is very funny how she found her
way here, and why she did not go back to the nest,
which I am sure she used to have somewhere in
Florida.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I could have told her what I knew, and made
her eyes blacker and larger than they were, but
when I remembered the little girls and boys at
home who had asked so often for a story which
they could understand, I said I’ll wait, and some
day when I feel like it I will write it, and so let
other children, whose names I do not know, but
whom I love because they are children, read the
story which I heard the Red-bird tell that Christmas
morning when I sat under the magnolia-tree far
away in Florida.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was Christmas Eve, and the first snow
of the season lay upon the fields of Oakfield,
and the wintry wind blew cold and
chill through the leafless trees in the yard
and shook the windows of the old red farm-house,
where Uncle Obed Harris lived, and where in his
comfortable kitchen he sat waiting for the supper
which his wife, whom everybody knew as Aunt
Hannah, or Grandma Harris, was putting upon the
table. Across the common and distant from the
house a quarter of a mile or more, the stone church
was seen with lights shining from every pane of
glass, for the worshippers at St. Mark’s had that
night, in addition to their usual Christmas-tree, an
illumination in honor of Bethlehem’s child, born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>amid the Judean hills so many years ago. And
ever and anon as Uncle Obed took his tea he heard
the merry sound of sleigh-bells and the happy
voices of the children as they went tripping by,
excited and eager to know what the tree held for
them on its many and beautiful branches of green.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thirteen years since Uncle Obed had been
inside his church on Christmas Eve, and during all
these years he had nursed only bitter memories of
the night when his daughter, Agatha, had made
such glorious music in the organ loft, and then
sang so sweetly the “Peace on earth, good will
toward men,” with a soft look of ecstasy upon her
face which the proud old father thought sprang
wholly from a love divine, never dreaming of the
terrible blow in store for him, when, after the
services were over, he waited in vain for Agatha to
join him on his homeward walk; Agatha did not
come either then or ever after, and he heard next
day of a marriage performed by a justice of the
peace and knew from the note sent to him that
Agatha was gone with the young man whom he
had forbidden her ever again to speak to if she
cared to be his daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must choose between Homer Hastings and
me,” he had said, and she had chosen, and his door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>was henceforth barred against her, and she knew it,
and accepted the situation, and wrote once or twice
to her mother from New York, and said that she
was happy, and told of a little girl baby, whom she
called <em>Ruth</em>, and who had her grandmother’s soft
brown eyes and hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then for a time they lost all trace of her until a
letter came, telling them her husband was dead and
asking if she might come home; Aunt Hannah
pleaded with Uncle Obed then, begging him to go
for their child and the little one, who would
brighten their lonely lives, but he said: “No, she
has made her bed and now she must lie in it. She
was my <em>eyes</em>, and when they are once pulled out you
can’t put them in again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Obed and his wife had married late in
life and were old when Agatha was born, and it
seemed as if the father loved her more for this, and
her desertion of him for a worthless fellow, whose
only virtue was his handsome face, had hurt him
cruelly, and he would not forgive, and he kept
aloof from the Christmas-tree, which was each year
set up in the church where other fingers than
Agatha’s swept the organ keys, and another voice
sang “Glory to God on High.” But he was going
to-night; he had promised his wife that he would,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and Aunt Hannah’s face had been brighter all the
day for that promise, and her step brisker and
lighter as she prepared the basket of presents for
the poor children of the parish, thinking, as she
folded up a pair of lamb’s wool stockings, of the
little Ruth whom she had never seen, and whose
feet they would just fit. Where was she now, and
where was Agatha that wintry day when the snow
was drifting down so swiftly, and the wind was
blowing so hard over her native hills. Something
seemed to bring the absent one nearer to Aunt
Hannah, and she almost felt the touch of the chord
which was to have a beginning that night far away
in New York and which would reach even to her
lonely home and make it bright as the sunshine,
which, as the day wore to a close, came through the
dull gray clouds and fell soft and warm upon the
pure white snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a great crowd in the church that night,
and Uncle Obed felt a throb of pain cut like a knife
through his heart when he saw the gaily decorated
tree, and heard the organ peal and the children’s
voices telling of the “wonderful night” when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Angels and shining immortals,</div>
      <div class='line'>Crowding the ebony portals,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fling out their banners of light, on this</div>
      <div class='line'>Wonderful, wonderful, night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>He was thinking of thirteen years ago, and the
golden head he saw in the gallery where Agatha
sat in her bright beauty playing her Christmas
songs. But his wife’s thoughts were more with
Ruth, the unknown child, and as one after another
the little ones went up the aisle, she prayed softly
to herself, “God grant me life to see her some
day before this very railing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And God, who hears and answers the prayer of
faith, heard and answered hers, though in a different
way from what she had expected. As if the
sight of the Christmas-tree and the happy, joyous
faces of the children had softened Uncle Obed’s heart,
he talked much that night of Agatha and the baby,
as he always designated Ruth, who, if living, was
then twelve years old at least.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They haunt me,” he said; “and it seems as if
Aggie was here in this very room telling me to do
something—I can’t make out what.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has been close to me all day, too,” Aunt
Hannah replied, “she or the little one; and before
the train came in I was foolish enough to go to her
old room to see if all was right in case she came.
You know, it is just as she left it, only the curtains
are new.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, I know, wife,” and Uncle Obed lifted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>his head suddenly. “Should I be an old fool to go
to New York to-morrow and inquire?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Hannah had done with kissing years ago,
but now her arms were around her husband’s neck
in a trice, and her cheek was laid to his as she kissed
him fervently, while the great tears choked her
utterance and kept her from answering. But she
was understood, and the next morning, while the
bell was ringing for church and the Christmas sun
was shining brightly over the earth, Uncle Obed
sat in a corner of the car which was taking him to
New York and, as he hoped, to the lost ones he
sought. Aunt Hannah ate her Christmas dinner
alone that day, and after it was over went to
Agatha’s room and kindled a fire upon the hearth,
and felt her pulse beat with a new hope as she
watched the flames lapping the bits of pine and
then leaping up the chimney mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He may not be home in three or four days,”
she said to herself, “but it’s well to be ready; and
the room needs airing so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So she opened both the windows, and brushed the
snow from the stools, and made the bed up fresh
and clean, and gave the pillows a loving pat as she
put them in their places, and moved Agatha’s favorite
chair nearer to the fire, and put the book of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Psalms upon it, with “Doddridge’s Rise and Progress,”
and by way of variety laid beside them one
of the Waverly Novels which Agatha used to like
so much and prefer to Doddridge or the Psalms.
This done, she shut the windows but left the
blinds open to let the sunshine in, thinking to herself
as she went out and closed the door, “I’ll build
a fire every day until he comes back with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas for Aunt Hannah praying so often and
waiting so anxiously for him and them, she little
knows how long and severely her faith is to be
tested, or of the rich fruition which will crown that
faith at last.</p>

There was no snow in New York that
Christmas Eve, but the wind seemed
colder for that, as it blew in sharp biting
gusts through the dark streets and alleys,
and sweeping up a long flight of rickety stairs to
one of those tenements where the poor live,—God
only knows how,—crept through the wide cracks of
a room where two little girls crouched before the
fire, which the elder of them was trying to coax into
a blaze. She had been out all day in the crowded
streets offering her pins and shoe-lacings and
matches, first to one and then to another of the gay
throng hurrying by, all, or nearly all, in too great
haste to notice her, shivering with cold and pinched
with hunger though she was. Had they done so,
they would have seen that she was no ordinary
child, and her soft brown eyes, and sweet pale face,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>would have attracted attention to her at once. But
it was the day before Christmas, and though money
was spent by the thousands for toys which would
please for an hour, and then lie idly upon some
nursery floor, only twenty-five cents of it came to
poor little Ruth, who wanted it so much, and whose
eyes had in them a wistful, anxious look every time
she offered her wares for sale. She did not tell a
pitiful tale of her mother, dead six months before,
or of the poverty and the sorrow, as one article after
another was sold for food and fuel, until the comparatively
comfortable home was bare of nearly
everything, save the absolute necessities for daily
use. Neither did she tell of her struggles to earn
bread for herself and Rena, darling little five-years
old Rena, whose eyes were like the violets of
spring, and whose hair was golden in the sunshine,
with a tinge of red upon it. Poor little Rena, who
kept the house at home while Ruthy was away,—who
washed the two plates and the one mug they
shared between them, and swept the floor and
washed the hearth, and wiped the dingy paint, as
her mother had done when it was not as dingy as
now, and did it more than once to pass away the
long, lonely hours of Ruth’s absence. She had been
told never to play with the children in the street,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and her dead mother’s command was sacred to the
conscientious child, who contented herself with
looking from the windows of the fourth story,
where she lived, down upon the moving, everchanging
crowd in the narrow street below.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here she sat waiting for Ruth, as the short
December day drew to a close, and the cold night
shut down over the great city. She knew all about
Christmas eve and Santa Claus, and many times
that day she had said to herself, “I wish Santa Claus
would bring Ruthy something,” and once she
thought to go herself upon the walk and beg a few
pennies for “Ruthy’s present,” as she had seen
children do, but this had been forbidden, and so she
sat in her chair by the window and watched and
thought of many things, and among others, of
the story of Bethlehem, which she liked so much.
The lowly manger, the mound of hay, the meek-eyed
oxen with their long white horns, were things
she never tired of. But she delighted most in the
baby, the little boy and his mother, and she had so
wanted a book full of pictures which should tell her
all about it. There <em>was</em> such a one called “That
Sweet Story of Old.” Ruthy had said, and Rena had
made many plans for getting it when she was older,
while Ruth, too, had her own darling scheme with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>regard to it, and every day for a month, she had put
by a few pennies from her little earnings, and eaten
less herself, in order to save enough to buy the book,
as a Christmas gift to Rena. She had almost
enough that morning when she went out, but the
day was not a good one for her trade. Nobody
wanted boot-lacings and pins, when in all the shop
windows, there were so many beautiful things, and
if she bought the book, she must go without her
supper. But she did not care for that, though she
was very hungry, and the smell of the food which
came to her so often from the many basement
kitchens, nearly drove her wild. Still she did not
falter, and when at last she turned into the narrow
street, and ascended the long, steep stairway, the
book was under her shawl, and she had only two
buns and a hot roll in her hands. These she had
bought far up town, at Purssell’s, as a treat for little
Rena, to whom a lady had once given a Bath bun,
and who had talked of it ever since.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rena was off her guard, and in thinking of
Bethlehem had fallen asleep and let the fire go out,
so that it was dark and cheerless enough when
Ruth entered the room; but though very cold and
tired, she did not care for Rena’s remissness, as it
gave her time to hide the book which was to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>great surprise on the morrow when it was fairly
Christmas day. Putting it carefully away she
lighted the lamp and then tried to rekindle the fire.
The noise awoke Rena, who was soon beside her on
the hearth and looking into her face to see if the
day had been a good one.</p>

<p class='c011'>To little Rena <em>good</em> days meant a bit of meat for
supper with perhaps a piece of pie, and a warm fire
in the evening, and she saw that none of these
luxuries were in store for her that night, and the
old, patient, but sad look came back to her face as
she wound her arms around Ruthy’s neck and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t get much; but no matter, you’ve
got <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, Ruth had little Rena, and forcing down a
great sob just as she had forced it down the livelong
day when she remembered other Christmas tides,
she held her darling sister close to her and parted
her bright-hair from her brow, and told her of the
nice Bath buns from Purssell’s and the roll for
breakfast, and said she did not want anything herself,
as she had had her supper, meaning a part of
an apple she had found near a fruit stand.</p>

<p class='c011'>And hungry little Rena ate a bun, sitting on the
floor by the fire, for neither of the girls thought it
worth while to set the table just for a single bun!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>And as Rena ate she talked of Christmas and
Christmas trees, and asked Ruth to tell her again
of the tree which she saw once, and which had on it
a doll and a paper of candy for her. “Jesus’ birthday
party” Rena called the Christmas eve festival,
and as she warmed her blue hands by the fire, she
wished that she might go to His “party” and get
“oh, lots of things—some new shoes and stockings,
and a doll that would squeak, and some mince pie,
and that story of Jesus—only, Ruthy, I’d give them
all to you, ’cause you goes in the cold, but I’d keep
the book about the pretty Bethlehem child,” she
said, as she stuck out her little feet with her ragged
shoes and looked ruefully at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor little Rena, there were shoes and stockings
both, just fitted to her cold feet, in the basket Aunt
Hannah carried to the Oakfield church that afternoon,
but Rena knew nothing of them, and she kept
on talking to Ruth, asking finally what it was their
mother had said about her old home in the country
where there was grass in summer, with flowers and
birds, and always enough to eat and “Jesus’ birthday
party” every year in the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Ruth told her again of the house of which
she had heard so much from her mother; and Rena
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“If we’ve a grandpa and grandma there, why
doesn’t they come for us? It’s so cold here, Ruthy,
and I’s so hungry, too. I want the other bun so
bad, and I’s savin’ it for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were great tears on Rena’s cheeks as she
confessed that her hunger was greater than her
spirit of self-denial could endure. She had meant
to keep the other bun for Ruthy’s breakfast, but, as
she said, she was “so hungry,” and Ruth made her
eat it, and then to save the fire, they crept into bed,
but not until their prayers were reverently said,
Rena venturing to improvise a little and ask God
“to send them a great big fire, which should make
them, oh, as warm as toast—and let her sometime
go to His Son’s birthday party and get something
from the tree, please, for Christ’s sake; good night,
and don’t let us be cold any more, amen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Rena’s prayer, and then nestling close
to Ruth, she whispered, “God is here, isn’t He; in
this room?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” was Ruth’s reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And hears me pray when I say ‘please, for
Christ’s sake?’ And I am sure he <em>will</em>, for mamma
said so, and we’ll be warm to-morrow, Ruthy, you
and I; oh, so warm, with a big fire—fire—for
Christ’s sake—please.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The words were far apart and indistinct for
little Rena was fast falling into dreamland. But so
long as consciousness remained, there was a prayer
in her heart for “fire—a big fire to warm us, please.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And God, who was there, in that humble room,
and heard their prayer, answered it in His own way,
which was not exactly little Rena’s way.</p>

The Christmas Eve Festivals were over,
and night brooded silently over the great
city, until the clock on Trinity rang for
twelve; then a few moments went by,
and the great bell at Jefferson market sent forth its
warning, which was caught up and repeated faster,
louder, more excitedly, as the mad flames, let loose
from the nooks and corners where they had perhaps
been smoldering through the day, leaped high in
the air and ran riotously over the roofs of the old
tenement house on —— street, where Ruth and
Rena lay sleeping. “Fire,—fire,—” how the cry
sounded through the streets, and what a clatter the
firemen and the people made and how the women
shrieked and the children cried, and nobody but
God thought of Ruth and Rena. He was taking
care of them, and woke Ruth just as the flames
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>looked for an instant into the room, already filled
with smoke, and then were subdued by a powerful
jet of water, which left all again in darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ruth knew what it meant, and with a gasp of
suffocation sprang from the bed, and groping her
way to the door, opened it wide, hoping to admit
the fresh air, without which she knew she must
smother. But only thick, dark billows of smoke
came rolling in, filling her lungs and eyes and
mouth, as she tried to find her way back to her
sister to whom she shrieked, “Wake, Rena; the
house is on fire. Run for your life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cry awoke Rena, who staggered toward the
door, more by chance than design. Fortunately for
her, it was still open, and, blinded by smoke, and
wild with fright, she rushed down the stairway, and
escaped unharmed into the street below, where the
excited throng of people were running and shrieking,
and where she would have been trampled to
death, if a city missionary, had not found her as,
in her night dress, with her little white feet nearly
frozen, she ran hither and thither, sobbing in a
pitiful kind of way for “Ruthy” to come and get
her. One of the mission houses received her, and
when the Christmas dawn broke over the city, and
the bells were pealing merrily she lay on one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>little cots asleep, her lips occasionally whispering
softly, “Come, Ruthy, come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fright and exposure brought on a low fever,
and for weeks kind nurses watched by her trying to
make out something from her not very clear story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother’s dead,” she said, “I haven’t any papa;
Ruthy and me lives alone, and sells pins and things,
only Ruthy sells ’em and I keep house, and she’s
burned, and I’s Rena Cutler and she isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was her story, and as nothing more could
be learned of her or of the Ruth of whom she talked,
and as it was known that several had perished in
the flames, it seemed probable that Ruth was one of
them; and Rena’s fever ran higher, and she talked
of the baby of Bethlehem and Jesus’ birthday party,
and the buns from Purssell’s, but after a time she
grew better, and was interested in things around
her, and was a great favorite with every one and
happy in her new home, where all the influences
were calculated to strengthen the good there was in
her when she lived with Ruth in the old house.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she never forgot “poor Ruthy,” whom she
believed to have been burned to death, and every
night she prayed that God would make her “good
enough to go some day to Heaven where Ruthy and
mother were; amen, for Christ’s sake, please.”</p>

Uncle Obed had not found his lost
daughter in New York, or any trace of
her; but he heard of the fire, and he
went down and looked at the ruins, and
stood close to the place where little Rena came
shrieking down the stairs into the streets; then he
went to the Mission House on Sunday and heard
the children sing their songs, and saw them take
their evening meal, and went into the room where
little Rena lay and saw her bright-hair on the pillow
and just the outline of her pale face, and heard she
was one of the little ones rescued from the fire.
He left ten dollars with the matron to be used for
her and “the other wee ones, God bless them!” and
then went home and told Aunt Hannah, who all the
winter long worked for that Home in New York,
and sent to it more than one garment which happened
to fit Rena.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>And so five years went by, and then there came
to Oakfield one day an agent for the Home, and
with him several little girls for whom places were
wanted. Rena was among them, and in her soft
blue eyes and pretty face there was something which
appealed strongly to the sympathy of Aunt Hannah,
who took the child for her own and brought her
home and put her in the room which had been
Agatha’s, and gave her so much love and kindness
that the little girl sometimes wondered “if Heaven,
where Ruthy was, could be better than this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There in Oakfield she saw, for the first time, the
Christmas-tree in all its glory, and “Rena” was
called so many times, that at last when she came
back with a huge doll which Aunt Hannah had
worked at in secret for weeks, she hid her face in
her hands and sobbed hysterically, so great was
her happiness. That was to her in truth “Jesus’
birthday party,” and when that night she knelt
alone in her room, she thanked Him in her quaint
way for all the joy and brightness crowning her
young life, and then, with a sigh as she remembered
poor Ruthy, asked that if there were Christmas
trees in Heaven, Ruthy might see one and get
everything she wanted, just as she had done.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Rena paused with a thought of the book
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>she had coveted so much, and which Ruth had
promised to buy as soon as she saved money enough.
Rena had never seen the book, for Grandma Harris,
as the child called her, knew nothing of it, and the
nearest Rena had been to possessing it was on that
night when Ruth had hidden it away so carefully
against the morning which dawned upon them amid
smoke and flame. The book had burned to ashes;
Rena was there at Grandpa Harris’s; and Ruth, as
she believed, was in Heaven with the mother whom
Rena could scarcely remember. Fright and sickness
had driven some things from her mind, but Mr.
and Mrs. Harris knew that she was picked up on the
street on the night of a fire and that her name was
Rena Cutler. They knew, too, about poor Ruth, and
Grandma Harris had wept more than once over the
two little girls living alone in the cold, forlorn chamber
of the dreary tenement house. So much Rena
could tell, but when it came to her mother she remembered
nothing except that she was good, and sick,
and died; and so grandma never suspected the
truth, or dreamed why the orphan seemed so near
to her and her husband, both of whom would have
been very lonely now without the little girl to
whom they had given their name, so that she was
known to everybody as Rena Harris.</p>

Swiftly the years came and went till
Rena had been for more than four years
in Oakland, and was a fair, sweet-faced
girl of thirteen, when one day, toward the
last of August there came to the farm-house from
the hotel on the hill across the river, a young man
whom Rena had seen in church and who she had
heard was stopping in town with his wife. Occasionally
he had driven by the farm-house, and
Rena had caught sight of a pale, beautiful face which
had made her heart throb quickly with a feeling she
could not define. It was a young girlish face, and
Rena was surprised when she heard that the lady
was the young man’s wife, and very sorry and
grieved when she further heard that she was crazy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not quite right in her mind,” George Rivers
said, when he came to the farm-house to ask if they
would take his poor “Daisy” for a few weeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“She lost her baby six months ago,” he said, “and
she’s been strange ever since. I brought her to the
country hoping a change from the city would do
her good, and I think she is improving. We have
driven by here several times, and for some reason
she has taken a great fancy to this place, and says
she could sleep and should get well if she were here,
so I called to ask if you will take her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The price offered was remunerative, and as
dollars were not so very plenty with the old couple
they consented at last to take the young lady, whom
her husband called Daisy, and whom Rena felt
that she should love so much. She was a wonderfully
beautiful little creature, not much taller than
Rena herself, and her soft, brown eyes had in them
an expression so sad and pitiful, that Rena could
scarcely keep back the tears when she saw her
coming in leaning upon her husband’s arm. There
had been talk of a nurse to look after her when
George returned to the city, but Rena had begged
so hard for that office that Mr. Rivers had consented
and Rena was to attend her, and she came at once
to the invalid and showed her to the large, pleasant
chamber which adjoined her own, and which overlooked
the town and the hill country beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is so nice—so like a dream I’ve had of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>something. I shall be better here,” Daisy said, as
she leaned from the window and looked out upon
the yard and garden below.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I do anything for you? I am to be your
little maid. I am Rena Harris.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was what Rena said as the lady turned from
the window, and Daisy’s brown eyes looked wonderingly
at her, while a deep flush suffused the white
face for an instant and then left it paler than
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rena, Rena,” she repeated; “I never knew
but one, and she is with the angels. I called baby
<em>Irene</em>, and she died too. Rena; it’s very strange
that you should have that name.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Daisy was talking to herself now, for at the first
mention of <em>Irene</em>, Rena had darted down stairs to
Aunt Hannah, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve got it now—my real name. You know I
never could think for sure, but the moment she
said her baby was Irene, it came back to me. That
was the name in the Bible—<em>Irene Cutler</em>, and Ruth
read it to me once and she called me Rena. Oh,
grandma, you don’t know how sad the lady looked
when she said, ‘Rena, Rena!’ I shall love her so
dearly, and I mean to take such good care of her,
too.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Rena was as good as her word, and soon loved
the beautiful Daisy with a devotion both rare and
curious, while Daisy never seemed happier than
when her little maid was with her. She was very
pretty with a fair creamy complexion, soft brown
eyes and abundant hair of the same shade, which
she wore in braids coiled about her head, while,
added to her beauty was an air of grace and gentle
dignity which alone would have made her very
attractive. She did not seem to be really crazy;
her mind was only weak, and sometimes when talking
of her baby she said queer things, which showed
that her reason was not quite clear. But the quiet,
happy life she led at the farm-house began to have
its influence, and when in September her husband,
who had returned to Boston after seeing her comfortably
settled, came again to Oakfield, he found
her greatly improved. She was very happy there,
and begged so hard to be allowed to stay until after
Christmas that both Mr. and Mrs. Harris and her
husband consented, while Rena was wild with
delight when she heard of the arrangement.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. Rivers first came she had feared that
she might lose the sweet lady whom she loved so
much, but now she was to stay a long time, it seemed
to her, and her joy knew no bounds, while she redoubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>her efforts to please and amuse her patient
who owed much of her improvement to Rena’s care.
Together in the bright autumn days they roamed
over the fields and thro’ the woods of Oakfield, and
the villagers sometimes saw them sitting on the
banks of the river, Rena at Daisy’s feet, looking up
into the lovely face above her, while Daisy’s fingers
caressed her golden hair, or wove for it a crown of
the rich-hued autumn leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once Daisy said to her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You make me think so much of the sister I
lost; her name was Rena, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me about her, please,” Rena said, and
Daisy replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sometime when I am stronger I will, but now
it makes my brain thump so to think of her. Oh,
Rena, Rena, my darling, my darling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She covered her face with her hands, and Rena
could see the tears trickle through her fingers as she
rocked to and fro, whispering of things which perplexed
and puzzled the little girl to whom they did
not seem strange or new.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a little Daisy became quiet, but for many
days she was not quite herself, and Rena never
spoke again of the dead sister, and the autumn went
by and the winter came with its dull gray clouds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and wailing winds, and still Daisy tarried at the farm-house
where she was to remain until after the holidays.
These her husband was to spend with her,
and he came the day before Christmas with gifts,
some for his wife, some for Mr. and Mrs. Harris,
and some for Rena. Among these last was a book—too
young it might seem for a girl of thirteen, but
it had been gotten up with beautiful binding and
colored prints expressly for the holidays, and its
title was:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“THAT SWEET STORY OF OLD;</div>
    <div class='c002'>OR</div>
    <div class='c002'>THE LIFE OF JESUS.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Very carefully, nay, almost reverently, Daisy
took the book in her hand and her eyes were full
of tears as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is beautiful, but not much like the one
I bought that day for my darling. Oh, George,
how the Christmas holidays bring her back to me,
and I see her just as she looked that last night
kneeling by the fire and talking of ‘Jesus’ birthday
party,’ and what she wanted from the tree if
she ever went to one—shoes, and stockings and a
doll that would squeak, and some mince pie and the
story of Jesus and she would give them all to <em>me</em> but
the book, she said, because I went in the cold, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>George, her shoes were so ragged then and her little
toes so blue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, I know. Don’t talk of it any more;
it excites you too much,” George said, as he drew
his young wife fondly to him, but Daisy answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must talk. I feel just like it, and the words
will choke me if I do not let them out. I have
thought of Rena all day just as I always do at
Christmas time. It’s eight years to-night since the
fire, and I loved her so much; she was so sweet
and pretty, with a look in her eyes like Rena
Harris, whom I love for her sake. Darling sister,
I see her now as she prayed for a big fire to warm
her and Ruthy, as warm as toast, and God sent the
fire and burned my precious sister up. Oh, George,
does he always answer prayer that way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere George could reply there was the sound of
a choking sob by the open door, a rush across the
floor, a folding of arms tightly around the astonished
Daisy’s neck, while Rena’s voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Ruthy, Ruthy,—you <em>are</em> Ruthy and I am
Rena. I was not burned that awful night, but
thought you were, and have cried so often for you.
God did answer my prayer and I never was cold
any more. I am Rena Cutler and you are sister
Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Rena had been passing the open door when her
attention was attracted by hearing Daisy repeat the
title of the book she had once coveted so much.
Involuntarily and without any intention of listening,
she paused a moment and heard that which
kept her riveted to the spot, while the hot blood
surged wildly through her veins at Daisy’s story.
She did not stop to reason or ask herself how that
beautiful young lady, with all the signs of wealth
and culture around her, could be the Ruth who once
sold matches in New York, and lived with her in
that cheerless upper room. She knew it was she—the
Ruth she had mourned as dead,—and with a
glad cry she went to her, and falling upon her neck,
claimed her as her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Daisy neither shrieked, nor fainted, nor
cried out, but sat like one dead, while George unclasped
Rena’s arms from her neck and questioned
her of the past. Very rapidly Rena told her story,
and Daisy listened till the color came back to her
face, and the tears flowed in torrents, while sob after
sob shook her frame, and her lips kept whispering
gladly: “Thank God; thank God, it’s Rena, it
is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. and Mrs. Harris were now summoned, and
to them George appealed for confirmation of Rena’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>story. As concisely as he could Grandpa Harris
told what he had heard of Rena from the man who
brought her to Oakfield, and when he had finished
even Mr. Rivers himself could no longer doubt that
Daisy had found her sister, and drawing Rena to
him he kissed her fondly in token of his recognition
as a near and dear relation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Daisy’s story was soon told. After her frantic
call for Rena to waken she had fallen senseless
upon the floor, where she would have died but for
the women who occupied the adjoining room, and
who suddenly remembered the little girls and
called to a fireman to save them. The flames by
this time were rolling up the stairway, and Ruth’s
hair was scorched when the brave man reached her
and bore her safely into the street. To venture
again into the roaring mass of fire was impossible,
and as none of Rena’s acquaintances chanced to see
her in the crowd, it was supposed that she perished
in the flames, and not all the good fortune which
came to Ruth could ever obliterate the memory of
that dreadful night, or her sister’s terrible fate. A
kind woman belonging to the better class of poor
had taken Ruth into her house, where within a few
days came Mrs. Rivers, from far uptown, to get
plain sewing done. Six months before she had lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>her only daughter, who was just Ruth’s age and
size, and something in the face of the desolate young
girl attracted the lady’s notice, and when she heard
her story it seemed as if her own dead child from
the grave in Greenwood, was pleading for the
orphan. And so it came about that Ruth found
herself in a beautiful home, where, as Mrs. Rivers’
adopted daughter, every want was supplied, and
she went no more into the street to sell her humble
wares. So certain did Rena’s death seem, that no
effort was ever made to find her, and for more than
two years the sisters lived in the same city, and
possibly met sometimes in the street, as Ruth rode
with Mrs. Rivers in her luxurious carriage, and
Rena took a walk with a teacher or older girl.
Then Mrs. Rivers moved to Boston, and three years
after Rena was sent to Oakfield, so that their lives
were as far apart from each other as they were different
in incident.—Loved, and petted and caressed,
Ruth, to whom Mrs. Rivers gave the name of
Daisy, had no wish ungratified which money could
procure, and she grew up a beautiful and accomplished
woman, retaining still the same sweet unselfishness
of disposition and gentleness of manner
which had marked her childhood, when she went
hungry that little Rena might be fed. At eighteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>she was married to the nephew of her so-called
father, and after the birth of a little girl, whom she
named Irene, she seemed perfectly happy until her
infant died, when she sank into a weak, peculiar
state of mind from which nothing had power to
rouse her until Providence directed her to Oakfield.
There she felt at home from the first, she said; the
place reminded her so much of the house she had
heard her mother describe so often.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And,” she continued, taking up her story where
George had left it, “I never thought of it when I
first came here. I guess I did not think of anything,
but mother’s name was Harris—Agatha
Harris—and she——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Daisy never finished the sentence, for ere another
word could be uttered Grandpa Harris fell heavily
against his wife, with the look of death on his face.
The shock was too great for him to bear, and they
laid him fainting upon the couch, while Aunt
Hannah, Daisy and Rena bent over him, trying to
restore him to consciousness. When he was himself
again and able to listen, it needed but few words
more to convince him that the Rena whom he loved
already as his own, and the beautiful Daisy, whom
he looked up to as a superior being, were both the
children of his daughter, whose marriage with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Homer Hastings twenty-one years ago that very
night had so offended him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Daisy could remember very little of her own
father. He had been kind, she knew, and they had
been comfortable while he lived, but after his death
they were very poor till her mother married a Mr.
Cutler, who though a worthy and respectable man,
was always sickly, and died soon after Rena’s birth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So long as mother lived, we did pretty well,”
Daisy said. “She took in sewing and I went for
and carried home the work; but when she died and
we sold the things to pay the doctor’s bill, and
keep us from starving, it was so hard; then I
peddled in the street and tried to earn a living, and
tried to be good and remember all mother had
taught me, but sometimes, when I was so cold, and
nobody bought, and the ladies held their purses
tight if I came near them, and the newsboys halloed
after me, and Rena was home so hungry waiting for
me, I thought God had forgotten us; but Rena
never did. Her faith was always strong, and her
sweet, baby words of comfort kept my heart from
breaking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were all sobbing but Daisy, who alone
was calm, as she went over the dreadful past which
was now done with forever. Cold, nor hunger, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>insult, would ever touch Daisy again, and, as some
great shock frequently unsettles the mind, so, contrarywise,
it sometimes restores it, and the excitement
and surprise of finding her sister and friends
seemed to restore Daisy’s reason wholly, and after
a moment she said, as she put her hand to her head
and turned to her husband with one of her brightest
smiles, “It is all gone,—the confusion and uncertainty.
Every thing is clear as it was before
baby died. I am myself once more. Thank God for
giving me back my mind with all the other blessings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did seem perfectly sane, and never was there
a happier family group than that at the farm-house
on that Christmas eve. They did not go to the
church, for they felt that their joy was something
with which strangers had nothing to do, and they
kept the festival at home and talked together of all
the wonderful ways through which God had led
them, until the bell of the church across the common
rang for twelve and another Christmas morn was
ushered in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rena had her book at last,—the story of Bethlehem,—and
though many costlier presents have been
given her since, she prizes none of them so much as
that “sweet story of old” which came to her with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the sister she had believed to be dead. Her home
proper is in the city now, with Daisy, where her
winters are spent, and where Grandpa and Grandma
Harris often come; but, all through the summer
months, she stays at the old farm-house with Daisy
and the sturdy boy who has taken the place of the
little Irene. Uncle Obed always goes to the Christmas
festival in the old church, and though his
voice trills and shakes a little, he does not stop for
that, but with a silent thanksgiving in his heart for
the children restored to him, joins heartily in the
“Peace on earth, and good will toward men,” which
goes up to Heaven from so many tongues on that,
night of nights—that “wonderful night” when—</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was very cold down in the old lumber
yard which skirted the canal, and
Bennie’s little hands were numb and
blue as he gathered the bits of boards
and shingles and piled them in his basket, until it
seemed as if so small a boy as he could not lift the
heavy load. But Bennie was used to burdens and
hardships; indeed, he would hardly have known
himself without them, and when the basket was full
he took it in both his hands and walked slowly
along the towpath towards the miserable hovel he
called his home. As he came near the bridge a
young lady was going up the stone steps which lead
to the street above, and with her was a little boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>just Bennie’s age, but so different in looks and
dress and general appearance that one could not fail
to notice the contrast at once. Clad in a warm
winter suit of the latest style Wallie Morgan knew
nothing of cold or hunger and cruel neglect, and
the sight of Bennie, with his ragged clothes and old
slouched cap roused the boy nature and he called
out, “Halloo, there, tow-head! What are you stealing
chips for from my father’s lumber yard? I mean
to tell him of you, Mr. Out-at-the-knees.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Wallie!” said the young lady whose face
was very sweet, “you should not speak so to the
little boy. He looks very poor and very cold.
Come here, boy, and tell me your name and where
you live.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She held her hand towards the child, who was
scowling defiantly at Wallie, but who, at the sound
of her voice, seemed intuitively to recognize an ally
in her, and replied: “He ’allus calls me tow-head,
or out-at-the-knees, ’cause my hair’s white and my
trouses is tore. I can’t help it, I didn’t make myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who did make you?” the young girl asked,
and Bennie replied, “I dunno, mother’s dead and
pa gets drunk. I dunno nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t know who made you! That’s dreadful,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the lady said. “Why, you poor child, you must
come to Sunday school and into my class and I will
tell you about God. Will you come next Sunday?
It is the church on the corner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will <em>he</em> be there?” Bennie asked, nodding
towards Wallie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he is in my class, and I am his Aunt Nellie;
but he will be very kind to you. He is not a bad
boy. Come, and perhaps you may get something
at Christmas. Do you know what that is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it’s when the old chap fetches things down
the chimbly; but he never brung me none. We’re
poor, and Hetty keeps house and runs the streets
all the time, and Mag and I is alone. I’ll tell
Maggie, and mayby she’ll come. She’s got a new
gown Miss Katy give her. I must go now, we are
goin’ to have hasty puddin’ for dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took his heavy basket and almost staggering
under the load walked slowly away. As usual at
that time of day Hetty was out, but Maggie, a dark
faced girl of twelve, was waiting for him, and with
her help a fire was soon kindled in the old broken
stove, and the hasty pudding, of which Bennie had
spoken, was boiling and bubbling in the one kettle
the miserable house afforded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish we had some ’lasses, don’t you?” Bennie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>said, as Maggie poured into his dish more than half
of the blue milk she had begged of a neighbor.</p>

<p class='c011'>But molasses was a luxury quite beyond the
means of the Hewitts, and so Bennie ate his pudding
and skimmed milk, and told Maggie of Wallie
Morgan who had called him tow-heard and of the
beautiful lady who had invited him to Sunday
school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes that’s Nellie Morgan, his aunt; his
mother’s dead, and she keeps house and has a class,
a big one, in Sunday school, and give Jane Shaw a
doll and a dress and lots of candy and pop-corn last
Christmas, and her brother Tim got a top and a
whip.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My, that’s jolly; less go to her class next Sunday,”
Bennie said, his fancy caught with the top
and the whip, and the shoes which would keep his
little red toes from the cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Bennie was a delicate child and when Sunday
came he was sick and lay on an old rug in a
little room off from the kitchen where he was safe
from his drunken father, while Maggie went to
church and into Miss Morgan’s class.</p>

<p class='c011'>That day was a new era in Maggie’s life, and unmindful
of the bitter cold which struck through
her thin garments and made her shiver involuntarily,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>she hurried home to Bennie with the picture
card she had received and the wonderful story she
had heard of Jesus’ birthday and the baby born
among the cows and oxen in that far off manger in
Bethlehem. Wonderingly Bennie listened, asking
innumerable questions about the child; was he ever
cold, or hungry, and was he afraid of the cattle, and
did his father get drunk and thrash him? To all
these inquiries Maggie answered no decidedly, but
when Bennie asked if he really could hear what
every body said and would give them what they
wanted, Maggie was doubtful. She thought, however,
they better try it, and so the two forlorn little
ones knelt down as Maggie said they did in church
and tried to pray. But neither knew what to say
and when Bennie suggested that his sister ought to
know “’cause she’d been to meetin’,” she answered,
“I know they said Our Father, I am sure of that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Bennie scoffed at this idea, “That baby in
the hay our father! Why, pa is drunk down to the
grocery!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As well as she could, Maggie explained, drawing
some from her imagination, some from what Miss
Morgan had told her, and some from faint remembrances
of a time when her mother, who died at
Bennie’s birth, had taught her of God and Heaven.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Half convinced, half doubtful still, Bennie tried
again, and said, “Our Father, if you is my father,
and was oncet a little boy like me, give me something
to eat and some gooder trouses and shoes,
and a pair of lines on the tree when you have your
birth night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Christ’s sake; say that,” Maggie whispered,
and Bennie rejoined, “Who’s he! I shan’t do it. I’m
not goin’ to get ’em mixed, I’ll stick to Our Father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And surely the good Father, who is so kind and
pitiful to the little ones, heard that prayer of the
ignorant child, and would in His own time and way
answer it.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The snow had fallen all day long, and from
the window of his wretched home Bennie
had watched the feathery flakes as they
fell in perfect clouds, covering the old
lumber yard where only yesterday he had gathered
his basket of wood and chips, covering the tow
path which skirted the canal, and covering the roofs
of all the houses as far as he could see. It was the
first genuine snow of the season, and he wanted to
enjoy it as he saw some school-boys doing on the
bridge, but his toes were out of his shoes, and his
elbows were out of his jacket and there was that
little hacking cough to which he was subject every
winter, and which this season was worse than usual
and kept him awake at night. He had learned that
wet feet and chilled limbs increased it, and he
dreaded to lie all day long in that dreary little bed-room,
with no fire and nothing pleasant to look at.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>From his mother, who had been his father’s superior
in every respect, he had inherited a love of the
beautiful, an appreciation of comfort and pretty
things, which made the squalor around more offensive,
and he could not endure the thought of being
sick again, as he was a month ago, when he was
soaked in a rain and had the cough so badly; and
then, he wanted to go to the Christmas-tree that
night, and Hetty had said that he “should not stir a
step if there was any sign of his coughing, for she
would not be bothered with a sick young one
again.” So, lest he should take cold and cough
Bennie staid in doors all day and watched the falling
snow, and late in the afternoon hailed with
delight a rosy cloud in the west which said the
storm was over. It was not very cold, and when
the sun went down and the full moon rose up over
the carpet of pure white snow Bennie thought he
had never seen so beautiful a night, or felt as happy
as he did when starting for the church, with Maggie
as his chaperone. She had been three times to
Sunday school and when Miss Morgan asked for the
little boy seen that cold day in the lumber yard,
Maggie had told her of his ragged clothes and worn-out
shoes, and Miss Nellie, who was like an angel
of mercy in the homes of the poor, had made a note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of it; determining after Christmas was over to find
the child and do what she could for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was early when Maggie and Bennie entered
the church, but they found it nearly full, and
abashed at the sight of so many strangers and
attracted by the heat of the registers Bennie insisted
upon staying by them, near the door where he was
jostled by the crowd and jeered at by some thoughtless
boys who made fun of his old clothes and asked
“what he would take for himself, rags and all.” But
Bennie bore their jeers meekly and only doubled
his fist once, so intent was he upon the tree in the
chancel, bending with its hundreds of gifts. He
had never dreamed of anything like that, and his
belief in Bethlehem’s baby grew stronger as he saw
this tangible commemoration of his birth night.
How fine it all was, and how splendidly the rector
looked in his white robe, and how grandly the
music of the organ rolled through the aisles, making
the floor tremble under his feet, and causing him to
start a little and look down to see what was the
matter. And when the children began one of their
Christmas carols and sang of the “Silent night, the
holy night,” Bennie felt a strange thrill creep over
him and every nerve quivered with excitement as
he listened to the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“All is calm,—all is bright</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>       ·       ·       ·       ·       ·</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Glories stream from Heaven afar,</div>
      <div class='line'>Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia,</div>
      <div class='line'>Christ the Saviour is born.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Was Heaven, of which Maggie had told him such
wonderful things, any better than this, or the
children there happier than these whose faces looked
so eager and expectant as they went up to the tree,
and so full of joy when they came back? They were
calling the names very rapidly now, and Bennie
held his breath to hear, and watched them anxiously.
Wallie Morgan seemed to be a favored one, for he
was called many times, and when he came back
with a pair of red lines with little tinkling bells,
Bennie exclaimed aloud, “Oh, if they’d only call
<em>me</em>!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Would they? Was there anything for him on
that heavily laden tree? There were gifts for
Johnnie and Jakie, and Susie and Freddie, and Sam,
and yes,—certain and true, he heard his name at
last, or something like it, and half started forward,
when a rough boy caught his arm, saying, “’Tain’t
you. It’s a gal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No, it was not Bennie, but it was Maggie, his
sister, whose name he had heard and who received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>a Bible and a bundle of something which looked like
clothes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maggie Hewitt; Maggie Hewitt,” Bennie
heard a woman in front of him say. “That is a new
name. Who is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, some waif Miss Nellie has picked up, I
dare say,” was the reply. “She is always doing
such things, you know. Isn’t she beautiful to-night
with that long feather and jaunty sacque?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bennie thought she was beautiful and watched
her admiringly as she moved among her pupils,
sharing their joy and occasionally trying to repress
their wild spirits. Johnnie and Jakie and Tommie
again, and Susie and Katie and Anne, but no Bennie
Hewitt; he had been forgotten; there was nothing
for him, and with a choking, gasping sensation he
stood, holding fast to the pew railing in front of
him, while the grand old anthem Glory to God on
High, rang through the church, and the final prayer
was said. But the music and the prayer were
nothing to him now; faith in Bethlehem’s baby
was gone, and his little heart was as empty of
happiness as the tall tree was of gifts, and as full of
bitter disappointment as the church was of people,
all moving out and crowding him as they went.
Maggie had been near the chancel with Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Morgan’s class, and when at last she came there
were few left in the church, and these were gathered
about the rector, near the tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Ben, see what I’ve got; a bran-new
gown,” Maggie said, as she caught sight of her
brother.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sound of her voice Bennie’s pent-up grief
gave way, and a low, piteous, wailing cry reached
the ear of Nellie Morgan, who, in a moment was at
Bennie’s side asking what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everybody got somethin’ but me, and I never
had a darned thing. I thought the baby in the stable
would bring me suthin’; I asked him this mornin’
would he.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the sobbing reply of the little ragged
boy who cried as if his heart would break, while
Nellie tried to comfort him. In the multiplicity of
her cares she had forgotten him, and she felt so
grieved and sorry, until an idea struck her. There
were a few whispered words to Wallie, whose hands
were full, and then turning to Bennie, she asked
what he wanted most.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some lines and some shoes,” he said, and glancing
at his thin, worn boots, Nellie replied, “Poor
boy, you do need shoes, and you shall have them
to-morrow, while the lines,—” she turned appealingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>to Wallie, who, after a momentary struggle,
laid the lines in her hand. “Yes,” she continued,
“you shall have the lines to-night. Wallie gives
them to you, and is sorry for the naughty words he
said to you the other day. Now, shake hands and
be friends with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such generosity and self-denial were more than
Bennie could comprehend, and he stood staring
blankly at Wallie, while his lip quivered and the
tears rained down his cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Git out! Yer only foolin’,” he said, while the
glimmer of a smile showed round his mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wallie had felt like crying himself, but at the
sight of tears in another he assumed a show of manliness
and answered, “No, I ain’t foolin’. I want
you to have ’em. Auntie can knit me some more.
They are three yards long. Look!” and with a swift
movement he threw them across Ben’s neck, exclaiming,
“Get up there! Go ’long!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quick as thought Ben started off on a brisk
canter, with sundry little squeals and kicking up of
heels, and before the astonished rector could stop
it the two boys had made the entire circuit of the
church, one as driver and the other as horse! It
was an unprecedented thing, but Bennie knew no
better, and Wallie would not admit that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>sorry. It was the greatest fun, he said, and Ben was
the nicest kind of a horse, because he squealed and
kicked up so good! To Bennie that race was,
perhaps, the best part of the festival, though the
next day was to him the real Christmas, the white
day of his life, which he never forgot. There was
much cheer and festivity at the Morgan house that
Christmas time, for many guests were staying there,
and Nellie, as the mistress, had numberless duties
to perform, but she did not forget her promise to
little Ben, and just before the bell at St. Luke’s rang
for the morning service, the Morgan carriage
stopped at the wretched house where the Hewitts
lived, and Nellie entered the cold, dirty room, laden
with gifts for Bennie. There was a warm suit of
Wallie’s half worn clothes, a pair of shoes, with
mittens and tippet, a book of pictures, and a horse
on wheels, which, possibly, pleased the little boy
more than all the rest. He was very happy and
proud in his new clothes, and when the next Sunday
came and Nellie Morgan joined her class in Sunday
school Bennie was the first one she saw, his face all
aglow with excitement and eager expectancy.
Forlorn and despised as he was, he was no ordinary
child, and the quickness with which he comprehended
her and the aptness of his replies and questionings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>surprised and interested Miss Nellie, who
felt that she had known the child for years, so fast
did he gain upon her love during that first hour of
teaching. Regularly every Sunday after that,
through sunshine and storm, Bennie was in his
place, his lesson always perfect, and his brain
full of the puzzling thoughts which had come to
him during the week, and which only Miss Nellie
could explain. Of the child Jesus he was never
tired of hearing, and the story of Bethlehem was told
him again and again until he knew it by heart, and
prompted both Miss Morgan and his sister if, in
telling it, they deviated ever so little from the original.
Of Calvary and its agony he did not care to
hear. There was something horrible to him in that
three hours’ suffering, and the darkened sky and
opening graves, and he would far rather think of
Christ as a little child sleeping on a mound of hay,
or playing by the door of his home in Nazareth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seems if I got nearer to Him, and He was
sorrier for me when I’m cold and hungry and father
licks me so hard for nothin’,” he said, and his
prayers were mostly said to the baby boy he had
first heard about, and we have no doubt that God
listened with love and sympathy for the poor child
who sometimes asked so touchingly, “Was you ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>hungry, dear Jesus, and be flogged and cuffed as I
am when I hain’t done nothin’, and did the snow
come into your winder and cover the front of your
bed, and make you so cold at night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At first Bennie’s prayers were mostly interrogatories
of the Lord with regard to His early life;
but as he learned more from the faithful Nellie, he
came at last to ask for what he wanted in his own
peculiar way, and God, who always hears and
answers the prayer of faith like Bennie’s, heard and
answered him, as we shall see in our next chapter.</p>

The year had rolled round swiftly, and the
little ones of St. Luke’s were again looking
eagerly forward to Christmas Eve
and the wonderful tree, which all the
summer long had been growing down by the lake
and gathering new beauty and strength for the task
it was to perform. It was in the cellar of St. Luke’s
now, and the ladies and children were busy trimming
the little stone church on the corner, and
Maggie Hewitt was with them, holding twine and
pulling twigs for Miss Nellie, at whose side she
hovered constantly, and whom some of the young
girls called “Miss Morgan’s shadow.” But Bennie
was not there, and if you had gone down on the tow
path that winter day and entered the room, into
which the snow used to drift at night, and where
Bennie used to hide away from his drunken, crazy
father, you would scarcely have known the place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Nellie Morgan had proved the good angel of that
house, as of many others, and discovering that
appreciation of tidiness and comfort which Bennie
possessed to so great a degree, she had made his
surroundings as pleasant as possible under the circumstances.
Bennie was a delicate child, and often
sick for days and even weeks, and when Miss Nellie
found how distasteful to him was that dingy, dreary
room where the broken window was stuffed with
rags, and the damp, stained paper hung in strips on
the wall, she went to work with a will, and many an
article of cast off furniture found its way from the
garret of the Morgan house to the hut on the tow
path, and in comparison with his condition one year
ago, Bennie now lodged like a prince, and felt
almost as happy as one. There was fresh paper on
the walls, the window was mended, and a clean
white curtain hung before it; a strip of carpet
covered the floor, and Bennie’s bed was a wide,
capacious crib, which had once been Wallie Morgan’s;
and there, propped up with pillows and clad
in a bright dressing-gown, Bennie lay that December
day when his sister Maggie was busy at the
church where he so longed to be. A severe cold
had settled on his lungs, and for weeks he had kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>in doors, trying to subdue the tickling cough,
which harassed him day and night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, if I only can be well by Christmas, I want
to see Jesus’ birth night once more. Do you think
he’ll let me go?” he would say to Miss Nellie, when
she came, as she often did, to see him, and with
tears in her eyes Nellie would smooth the light hair
of the little boy who had grown so fast into her love,
and answer that she hoped so, when all the time
there was a great fear in her heart that never again
would Bennie celebrate the Saviour’s birth night.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she would not tell him so then, for she felt
sure that he was one of the little ones of whom our
Savior said “of such is the kingdom of Heaven.”
Her labor had not been in vain so far as Bennie was
concerned. With astonishing avidity he had seized
upon her words of instruction, and now, whether
awake or asleep, the baby of Bethlehem was always
present with him, the friend to whom he told his
joys and griefs and to whom he often prayed for his
drunken father, his idle, wicked sister Hetty, and
his other sister, Maggie, whom he loved so well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such a child could not fail to influence any
household for good, and it was observed by many
that Mr. Hewitt worked more steadily, and was not
intoxicated so often as of old, while Hetty was less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>in the street and never brought her vile, noisy companions
to disturb her sick brother. And Bennie
was very happy except when he thought of the
Christmas Festival and his desire to attend it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please, Jesus of Bethlehem, let me be well
enough to go there just this once and hear my name
called from the tree, will you, and I’ll be so good
and not fret at Mag when my side aches and I
cough so hard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Bennie’s prayer, or the substance of it,
said often to himself, but for once God did not
seem to hear the little boy, for his cough daily grew
worse, the pallor about his lips grew deeper, the
red on his thin cheeks redder, and his great blue
eyes had in them that bright, glassy look which
only the eyes of consumptives wear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t go; he won’t let me,” he said, with a
burst of tears, the morning before Christmas to
Miss Nellie, who had come down to see him, and
who tried to comfort him by saying that he would
be remembered just the same, and that his presents
would be new to him Christmas morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t that,” he answered with quivering lip,
“’Tain’t the presents. It’s going up myself and
feeling that <em>he</em> counts me in as one of ’em, I want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>hear Him call my name,—Bennie Hewitt, and know
how it sounds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a fancy of his that Jesus himself called
the names of the little ones, and Nellie did not try
to dispel the illusion. Jesus would call him soon,
she was sure, and with a kiss and a promise to come
again on the morrow she left him and went back to
the church where she was busy all the day with
Maggie as her constant aid. And while they
trimmed the house of God and hung their gifts
upon the tree, little Bennie lay in his crib thinking
about it and of the tree of life, of which Nellie had
once read to him. Would he ever see that tree, and
would there be something on it for him, and could
he bathe his burning cheeks and hands in that pure
river of water, and wouldn’t it be nice to have no
nights to cough so in, and no need of sun or moon
to light those golden streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was nearly dark when Maggie came in, full of
the beautiful church and the tree on which were so
many curious things.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something for you,” she said to Bennie. “I
saw more than one, and I’ll bring ’em to you when
it’s out. Don’t cry, Bennie, I’m so sorry you can’t
go with me. Next year you will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Maggie, I shall never go—never hear my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>name,” Bennie tried to say, but a fit of coughing
severer than any he had ever had came on and the
cloth he held to his lips was stained with blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither Hetty nor Mag knew the danger, or
what those crimson stains portended, and both went
to the church leaving their father with Bennie, who
at first lay very still and seemed to be asleep; then
he began to grow restless and asked his father to
read to him of the “golden city where the gates
stand always open and there is neither sun nor
moon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Hewitt was unused to the Bible, and did
not know where to find that description of the New
Jerusalem of which Bennie talked so much, sometimes
coherently and sometimes not, for his mind
wandered a little and was now in “Jerusalem the
golden, with milk and honey blest,” where the tree
of life was growing and where Christ’s name was
written on the foreheads of his children, and then
at the church where the names were called, his perhaps,
and he bade his father listen and tell him if
he heard it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t go up,” he said, “I’m so sick, but
Maggie will bring them, and next year I shall see
that other tree in the New Jerusalem, I guess I will,
I mean, for I have tried to be good since she told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>me how, and I’ve prayed to Jesus every day. Do
you love Him, father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no answer from the rough-faced man
who sat watching his child with a pain in his heart
such as he had not felt in years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!” and Bennie’s voice was very low and
pleading, “You ain’t drunk now one bit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, by Jove, no,” came emphatically from the
father’s lips, and Bennie continued, “Don’t ever be
so any more, will you? Promise me, father,
promise your little sick boy, who is going to die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Bennie, you must not die, and I’ve been so
hard on you, and flogged you when I was in drink,”
Mr. Hewitt sobbed, laying his head upon the pillow,
while Bennie went on: “But I’ve forgiven that,
father, and I was naughty sometimes, and called
you names and made faces at you when you did not
see me. I’m sorry for it now, and when I’m gone
remember me as I was at the best, when I tried to
be good, and, father, <em>don’t</em> drink any more, please
keep sober, for Maggie’s sake, and Hetty’s; will
you? Say you will; say it, father, quick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His wasted hand rested lovingly on the bowed
head of his father, who faltered out: “Yes, Ben,
I’ll try, I will, so help me God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And He will help you, father, I’ll ask Him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>now; He will hear me because I am going to die,”
and folding his hands reverently, Bennie prayed,
“Oh, Jesus, <em>man</em> Jesus, I mean; please keep father
from getting drunk, and don’t let him trade at the
groceries where they sell it; then he won’t see it
and want it so bad, and make him a good man, for
Christ’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bennie’s voice ceased, and for a long time there
was silence in the room, broken at last by the sound
of steps outside, and Maggie came rushing in, her
arms full of presents and her cheeks glowing with
excitement and exercise. But she stopped quickly
when she caught sight of Bennie’s face. It was very
white, with a rapt look upon it, as if he were already
lost to earth and was listening to “the shouts of
them who triumph, the song of them that feast.”
But her voice called him back and his eyes sparkled
with pleasure for a moment as she spread his
presents before him, and told him how many times
his name had been called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Six times; ’most as often as Wallie Morgan’s;
and look, here’s a Christmas card, and a bran-new
suit of clothes, and a ball, and a top, and a jumping
jack, and—and—oh, Bennie, guess what else; a pair
of skates from Wallie Morgan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had kept the skates for the last, knowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>how her brother had wanted them, and now, at
sight of them, he did seem to brighten up, and took
them in his hands and examined them carefully;
then, laying them where he could see them, he said,
“Yes, I’m so glad, and they are all so good. I’d
like to skate just once. I know I could beat Tom
Carter in a little while; but, Maggie, I’m going to
die. It came to me to-night. I’m going where Jesus
is, and pa is not going to drink anymore, and Hetty
must stay home nights, and you must be a real good
girl, and not romp and tear your clothes so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bennie, Bennie,” and all the brightness
was gone from Maggie’s face as she dropped beside
the bed, and seizing her brother’s hand begged of
him to stay with her and not leave her all alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father and Hetty will be with you, and Jesus,
too,” the pale lips whispered, and then Bennie’s
mind began to wander, and he talked strange things
of the Tree of Life, which he said was hung with
tapers and beautiful gifts, some of which were for
him, and he listened to hear his name, bidding his
father and sisters keep very quiet lest he should fail
to catch the sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>All night they sat by him, scarcely daring to
move, while, with closed eyes and parted lips, he lay
listening—listening—till over the snow-clad town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the grey morning broke and the Christmas chimes
were rung from the church tower; then with a
triumphant voice he cried, “There, he has called
me at last, little Bennie Hewitt, he said. Didn’t you
hear his voice? He’s there, with something for me.
I’m going now. Good-bye. Tell Miss Morgan she
told me the way, and I love her for it. I wish more
ladies would hunt up the poor little boys on the
canal. I’m going up the aisle, and the music is
playing, too. Such music! oh, Maggie, don’t you
hear it? It’s better than the ‘Silent Night,’ and I
hear the heavenly hosts sing ‘Alleluia.’ Little
Bennie Hewitt they call. Yes, I’m coming—coming—coming.
A golden harp and golden crown.
That’s what is on the tree for me and joy forever
and forever. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.”</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Little Bennie was dead and the Christmas he
had looked forward to so eagerly was kept with the
Saviour he loved, and when Miss Nellie came to
inquire for him she found only a white wasted form
which her own hands made ready for the grave.
The new suit of clothes which was to have kept
him warm, were put upon him, and flowers from the
Morgan conservatory were placed in his hands and
on his pillow, and over the little coffin bitter tears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>were shed and promises were renewed as the
wretched father whispered to himself, “I’ll keep my
word to Ben. I’ll try to be a man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There’s a small white head stone near the gate in
the Rosedale Cemetery, and Bennie’s name is on it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>Bennie Hewitt.</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Died December 25, 1883,</span></div>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aged 9 Years.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Strangers pass it by and think nothing of it, but
God knows all about that little grave and the boy
sleeping there, and when the Golden City shall
indeed come down and Christ’s saints be gathered
home, Bennie will be with them, where there is no
more night, or need of sun or moon, for the glory
from the Eternal Throne transcends the light of
noonday and Christ is all in all.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Does my story seem a sad one to you, my little
readers? In one sense it is, and in another it is not.
It is always sad to see the children die, but when
like Bennie they go from cold and hunger and toil,
to be forever with the Lord it is for them a blessed
thing, so, on Christmas morning of 1884 do not
think of little Bennie, as in the grave where they
laid him one year ago, but</p>

When I was a child, as young as some of
the children who may read this story,
I brought from the Sunday school one
afternoon the story of “Ruth Lee.” The
day was warm and bright, and the summer sunshine
fell softly on the grass in the old orchard, where,
beneath an apple-tree, I sat down to read about
Ruth and her half-brother Reuben, to whom she
was always so kind, even when he was cross and
irritable. The story was not a long one, and I read
it very rapidly, growing more and more interested
with every page, and wishing so much that I knew
just where the brother and sister lived, and if Ruth
still watched the web of cloth bleaching on the
mountain side, or Reuben in a pet threw his piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of pie over the ledge of rocks, where his good,
patient sister could not get it. To me every word
was true. I believed in Ruth and Reuben. I knew
just how they looked—Ruth with her grave,
womanly face and soft brown eyes, and Reuben
with his rosy cheeks, and round, hard head, which
he sometimes bumped upon the floor when in one
of his passions. I could see him bumping his head—could
see Ruth, too, trying to quiet and soothe
him. I would imitate her, I thought, and when my
little baby brother screamed and kicked and wanted
me to gather flowers instead of reading under the
apple-tree, as I was given to doing, I would put up
my books and go with him to the brook in the
meadow where the little fishes glided in and out
from their hiding-places and where the buttercups
and daisies grew on the side of the mossy bank. I
would be more like my older sister, who had borne
with my childish freaks, who always gave me the
fairest apple and the largest piece of cake, and who
might have stood for Ruth herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story was having a good effect upon me,
when suddenly I came upon a little note appended
by the author, and which said the whole was a fiction;
that no such person as Ruth Lee had ever
lived, and I had been reading what was not true.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>I did not know then that but few of the Sunday school
books are literally true, and I was terribly
disappointed. I felt that in losing Ruth I had lost
a real friend, and, leaning my head against the tree,
I cried for a few moments, thinking to myself, that
when I was older I would write a book for children,
which should every word be <em>true</em>. I am older now—much
older than I was then; that Sunday afternoon
lies far back in the past; the sister, who
might have been Ruth, is dead, and her grave is
under a little pine, which whispers softly to the
wind, of the gentle sleeper below. There are more
graves than hers near to the pine. The household
is broken up, and children of another name than
mine read under the old apple-tree in the orchard,
or search for violets and buttercups down by the
meadow brook. I have learned to know that stories
of fictitious people, if true to life and written with
an earnest purpose to do good, may oftentimes be
as beneficial as stories of real people; but I have
through all adhered to my resolution, that my first
story for children should be true; and so this bright
May morning, when the sky is beautifully blue, and
the grass in the garden is green and fresh with
yesterday’s rain, I begin this story of the Font,
which shall in every particular be <em>true</em>.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
I must tell you first about the Church
where the children who bought the Font
went to Sunday school. St. Luke’s we
call it, and it stands on the corner where
two streets cross each other, in a little village which
we will call Carrollton. That is not its real name,
you know, but I will call it that, and then go on to
tell you how the church is built of stone, with a
spire from which the paint has been worn off by
time, and the rains which beat against it from the
west. The window, too, on that side, has been
broken by the wind, and boards are nailed across
the top where the stained glass used to be. But the
window will be mended in time; the old spire will be
repainted; the ivy at the corner will reach higher and
higher, until the tendrils will cling perhaps to the
very roof; the fence will be built around that plot of
grass, which looks so fresh this morning; and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the church will be as nice and neat as it was the day
it was completed and consecrated to God. It is
very pretty now inside, and the fine-toned organ in
the gallery makes sweet music on a Sunday when
they chant the “Gloria in Excelsis” and sing
“Peace on earth, good-will to men.” That organ
has played the Christmas songs which tell of a
Saviour born, and the joyful Easter carols, which
proclaim a Saviour risen. It has pealed a merry
strain as bridal parties went up the aisle to the
altar bedecked with flowers, and then its notes have
been sad,—oh, so sad!—as strong men carried
coffins up the aisle and laid them on the table.
Two of them little coffins, with a dead boy in each,—boys
who once came to the Sunday school, but who
will never come again, or join their voices in the
hymns the children sing and the prayers they say.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the left of the chancel, looking toward the
organ, is a little enclosure, or room where the
singers used to sit, but which is now used for the
infant class;—the nursery which feeds the larger
Sunday school. It is nearly seven years since the
class was first organized, and, during that time,
there have been in it one hundred different children.
Three of these are dead,—three little boys,—and
they lie up in the quiet graveyard where the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>stones show so prettily through the dark evergreens.
Berkie was the first to die,—blue-eyed,
pale-faced Berkie, who used to sit so quietly all
through the Sunday school, with an earnest expression
on his thoughtful face and in his great blue
eyes, as if he were already looking away from this
world into the one where he was going so soon.
There is a picture on the wall before me of Berkie,
with many other members of his class, and I never
look at it without a sigh, as I recall the dear little
boy who used to run so gladly to meet me, and
listen so attentively to the stories I told him of
Jesus; and then I think of that innumerable host of
white-robed children</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “whose little feet,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pacing life’s dark journey through,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have safely reached the heavenly seat</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They had ever kept in view.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And I know Berkie is there with them, and I cannot
wish him back, though his going from us made
a sad vacancy in our little school, and left his
parents’ hearts so desolate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Children cannot be sorry long, neither is it right
they should; and so the members of Berkie’s class,
although they did not forget him, soon began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>wear their cheerful faces again, and look forward
to the Christmas festival, when the church was
hung with garlands of green, and in the chancel
was set up the young pine-tree, which, away in the
marsh by the lake, had been growing year by year,
and gathering strength in its young limbs to bear
the many gifts hung upon it by parents, and teachers,
and friends, when, on Christmas eve, they came
together to keep the birthnight of the child born in
Bethlehem’s manger more than eighteen hundred
years ago. Children are always happy on such
occasions, and it seems to me that the children of
St. Luke’s, in Carrollton, are particularly so, judging
from the eager joy which lights up their faces,
and beams in their eyes when they hear their own
names called, and go up the aisle to receive the
expected gift. I wonder every church in the land
does not have the Christmas trees, and thus give to
the children pleasant remembrances of that day,
without which we had indeed been shrouded in the
deepest gloom! True, we do not know the exact
date of Christ’s birth, but we know near enough,
and children should be early taught that Christmas
has a far deeper meaning than merely a day for
festivity and mirth.</p>

<p class='c011'>As far as possible the little ones of St. Luke’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>were taught to understand why the day was kept;
and that rosy, round-cheeked Fred did understand
was proved by his saying to his mother, “I know
what the Christmas-tree means. It is Jesus’ birthday
party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Freddie had caught the spirit of the thing, if not
its exact meaning; and as often as Christmas comes
round he will remember the child Jesus, whose
birth the church then commemorates.</p>

<p class='c011'>The summer following Berkie’s death the infant
Sunday school was unusually large, and every seat
was full, while a few of the smaller boys sometimes
sat upon the floor. There were some visitors in
Carrollton Parish that summer,—Susie Ganson
from Jersey City, Maggie Holmes from New York,
Lena and Ira Stevens from Philadelphia, and
Sammie Field from New Orleans,—and these were
all in the class. Then there was another Susie and
Maggie, with Louise and Maria, and Carrie, and
Fanny, and Mary, and Cora, and Ida, and Dell, and
Nellie, and Lizzie, and Lulu, and Jennie, and
Geenie, and two Emmas. Then came the boys,—a
host of them: five Willies, four Freddies, three
Franks, three Georges, two Walters, two Johns,
with Ezra, and Mason, and Eddie, and Charlie, and
Hugh, and Hunter, and Polie, and Newton, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>beautiful little Wallie,—the youngest of them all,—who
presented the Easter offering last year, and
whom we love so much because of his mother, who
died ere he could remember more of her than the
cold, white face which he patted with his dimpled
hands, as he said to the weeping ones around, “That
is my mamma.” Darling Wallie! God keep him
in safety, and bring him at last to the home where
his mother is waiting for him!</p>

<p class='c011'>To say that these fifty children were always quiet
and well-behaved would not be true; for sometimes,
when the day was warm, and they were
crowded more than usual, there was a pushing
among the boys, a knocking together of boots and
elbows, with a few wry faces made, and a few sly
pinches given. Then, too, they sometimes whispered
during prayers, and compared marbles and
balls, and traded Jack-knives; while the girls
thought sometimes of their new dresses, and the
ribbons on their hats. Do any of the children who
read this story play in Sunday school, and whisper
to each other when they should be listening to what
the teacher is saying? And do they know how displeasing
this is to God, whose eyes are upon them
everywhere, and who would have them reverence
his house? I am sorry to say that there were a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>children in the class who were very irregular in
their attendance. The most trivial thing would
keep them at home. The day was too hot or too
cold,—or their new clothes were not done,—or they
went out into the country to see their grandmother,—or
they wandered off to some other Sunday
school, where there was to be a festival or celebration,
from which they hoped to be benefited. For
this last the parents are especially to be censured.
Better have some regular place, and stay there; for
as a rolling stone gathers no moss, so no real good
can come from going to different schools, and
learning sometimes from one catechism, and sometimes
from another, and sometimes from none at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>One boy there is at St. Luke’s who deserves
especial notice for his regular attendance. The
day is very cold and stormy indeed which does not
find him there; and neither worn-out shoes nor
threadbare coat avail to keep him at home. He
does not always have his lesson, and he loses more
catechisms than I can tell; but he is <em>always there</em>;
and, what is better yet, he brings other children
with him. Six, in all, he has brought to the Sunday
school, and we call him our little “recruiting officer.”
He has a very high-sounding name,—“Napoleon
Augustus,”—but we all know him as “Polie.”</p>

There were many baptisms that summer,
and the little silver bowl was so often
called into requisition, that the people
began to think a marble Font would be
a most appropriate and useful ornament for the
church; and who more appropriate to buy it than
the children? So the teachers set themselves at
work to devise the best means by which it could be
done. And now, as it has something to do with
the Font, I must tell you of the Children’s Sewing
Society, which met every Saturday afternoon at the
different houses in the parish, and was composed of
the young girls of St. Luke’s, together with many
who came from the other denominations. There
were Carries and Lilies, and Adas, and Jennies, and
Nellies and Ellas, and Marys, and Kitty, and Lenas,
and Ida, and Annies, and Fannys, and many others,
and they worked at first upon a patchwork quilt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>intended for Nashotah. There were bits of calico
of every quality and hue, from flaming yellow down
to sombre brown; and the blocks were put together
with but little regularity or adaptation of one color
to another. But could the student, whom it will
keep warm next winter, have seen the group of
merry-hearted girls who worked upon that quilt,—some
with thimbles and some without; some with
long stitches and some with short,—and could he
know how engaged they were in the work, and how
anxious even the youngest of them was to learn to
sew for Nashotah,—he would forgive whatever
there is unsightly in the quilt, and hold it more
precious than the covering of kings’ couches. A
lady in the parish, who was deeply interested in the
children’s society, offered to give five dollars for
the quilt when it was done, and then send it herself
to Nashotah; and this five dollars was the
nucleus round which other funds were to be
gathered for the Font.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last a fair was suggested, and then the little
girls’ fingers worked faster and their faces grew
brighter as they talked together of what they could
make or do for the fair. It was the one absorbing
topic of conversation, and the society increased,
and all were busy with something which they intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>for the fair. I cannot enumerate all the
articles, for it would make the story too long; and
then I do not remember them. But I have in mind
the beautiful bead mats, which little Susie made;
and the elephant, as natural as the real ones which
sometimes come into town, with their fanciful
blankets on, and their big feet, which leave so large
prints in the sand. There was a little air-castle
made of straw, and designed for the flies to light
on; and every time I lift my eyes I can see it
hanging over my head, and I think of the bright-eyed
Carrie who made it, and who was so much
interested in the fair, even though she did not
belong to St. Luke’s Sunday school. There were
handsome hair-receivers, made by a young girl,
from New York, who was spending the summer in
Carrollton, and who contributed both labor and
material. Boys tried their skill in making mats on
corks, and harnesses for dogs; and all through the
parish the enthusiasm increased until the fair promised
to be a great success.</p>

  <h3 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='large'>WHAT WAS DONE IN THE INFANT CLASS FOR THE FAIR.</span></h3>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_249.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
There were two teachers in the infant
school,—one the mother of little Berkie
and the other Mrs. Hoyt, who wrote to
a friend in New York, telling him of the
fair, and asking if his little daughter would like to
send a few toys for the tables. Three days passed,
and then the answer came, not in the shape of toys,
but a crisp five-dollar bill from little “Susie Street,”
another five from “little Joe,” and two from “little
Mamie.” This was the answer; and the ladies,
who had sometimes felt discouraged, and feared
they might fail, believed that God was blessing
them in their efforts, and with earnest prayers
they gave the fair into his charge, and the result
proved how faithful he was to the trust. Not
satisfied with what his children had done, the kind
gentleman from New York, who was an editor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>interested his workmen in the matter, and the treasurer
was one day surprised with twelve dollars and
a half, contributed by the printers and workmen in
the press-room,—strangers, the most of them, to the
ladies of St. Luke’s—and the gift was all the more
acceptable for that, while many thanks and blessings
were showered upon the generous donors. In
Massachusetts, too, where the treasurer’s childhood
was passed, a few kind friends interested themselves
in the Children’s Fair, and eleven dollars more was
the result. And so the fund kept growing, as one
friendly hand after another was stretched out to
help, and the Font seemed almost a certainty without
the fair.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a plan of the teachers that the smaller children
should assist, and, either by saving or earning,
contribute their mites. And so each Sunday the
pennies were brought, while during the week the
little ones were busy as bees in devising ways and
means to save or earn for the fair. I wish you could
have seen the boys who lived in the brick house just
across the street from St. Luke’s. They were as
fond of play as boys usually are; but they gave it
up for a while, and the croquet mallets rested
quietly in the grass, and the old house-dog had a
worried, anxious look in his eyes, as if he wondered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>what had come over his young masters, and why,
instead of running up and down the walk with him,
they stayed so long out in the back yard, or climbed
the trees where he could not reach them. They
were picking plums, and piling up wood, and selling
grapes; and, as the result of their work, they
brought to the Sunday school over a dollar and a
half. And while they were thus busy, two little
girls, Susie and Maria, were picking apples, their
chubby faces getting very red and their white
aprons somewhat stained with the juicy fruit.
Down on Main street there was a soda-fountain,
and the delicious, creamy liquid was very tempting,
on a hot day, to the children who had the pennies
to spare, and in many cases the temptation was too
strong to be resisted; but a few denied themselves,
and brought the fruits of their self-denial to their
teacher, just as Willie Sutherland brought the
pennies which he had saved by going without the
chewing-gum which boys usually like so much.
To us these self-denials may look very small, but
God knew just how hard the struggle was in each
little heart, and he surely commended the offerings
as he did the widow’s mite, and blessed the children,
too, who made them. Fourteen dollars and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>thirty-three cents was the sum total which the children
saved in seven weeks; and never were pennies
more acceptable than these, which had cost the
children quite as hard a struggle as many a greater
self-denial costs those of maturer years.</p>

Oh, how it rained and rained for days and
days before the one appointed for the
fair, and how many anxious eyes were
turned up towards the clouds which
looked so heavy and gray and pitiless, as if they
never intended to stop raining again! It was hard
to believe that behind the dark mass the sun was
still shining, and the children watched in vain for
the “silver lining” which is said to invest every
cloud. But it appeared at last on the very day of
the fair, and patches of blue sky showed here and
there in the heavens, and before noon the October
sun was drying the walks and the wet grass, and
brightening up the little faces which for days had
been overcast with gloom. The fair was to be held
at a private house, and I wish you could have seen
the multitude of pretty things which came pouring
in, until the Brown Cottage looked like one great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>bazaar of toys and fancy articles. There were
cushions of pink and cushions of blue, and penwipers
and book-racks, and a beautiful whirling
butterfly which Lulu bought on Broadway, and
needle-books and spool-cases, and tidies of various
devices and colors, with mittens and gloves, and
fanciful lines with tinkling bells attached, and I
know a little boy, among the Massachusetts hills,
who to-day drives his miniature horses, of which he
has forty or more, with a pair of those very lines.
Then there were toys of every description sent from
New York by Susie Ganson’s mother, and spread
out upon the tables in the upper room, whose glass
door looked into the garden. There were jumping-jacks,
which turned the boys wild, and churns,
which made the little girls scream with delight.
There were washbowls and tubs, tin-kitchens and
rolling-pins, and bars to dry the dolly’s clothes on,
and chairs, and tables, and dishes, with balls and
canes, and old Santa Claus himself bearing his
Christmas-tree with the gifts to put upon it. There
was a negro, too, with his woolly head and calico
frock, looking so life-like and real that some of the
smaller children drew back from him in terror,
fancying he was alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Downstairs, in the bay window, and on a table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>where it could be distinctly seen, was the “Beauty
of the Fair,”—a little stained bedstead, which an
ingenious gentleman had whittled out with his penknife.
It was a most perfect thing, with castors
and mattress tufted with pink, with ruffled sheets
and pillow-cases, the ruffles all nicely fluted and
showing well against the covering of white
Marseilles. Upon it lay a handsome doll, in her
muslin dress and scarlet cloak, ready for the opera.
The two were to go together, and many a little girl
hoped she might be made the happy possessor of so
beautiful a gift. In a corner of the parlor, the
books which a kind New York publisher had given,
were arranged, together with the Fate Eggs, which
looked so pretty, suspended from the branch of
evergreen made to resemble a tree. The books and
the eggs were to be Jennie’s charge,—dear little
Jennie, with the pale, sweet face, whom everybody
loves and pities so much,—for Jennie is lame; and
when the other children of her age are at their merry
play, she can only lean upon her crutches and
watch the sport in which she can take no part.
Near Jennie’s corner the candy and flower tables
stood, and Annie and Carrie were to preside there,
and send out little peddlers with baskets of candy
and bouquets to sell.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>I must not forget to tell you of the famous fish
pond, as it was something new in Carrollton, and
proved a great success. A corner of the room was
divided off with a heavy curtain, on which the
printed words,</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>FISH POND</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>were pinned, while standing near were fishing rods
and lines, with hooks made out of wire. With
these the children were to fish, throwing the lines
over the curtain and into a box filled with toys of
various kinds, which a boy fastened upon the hooks
as fast as they came over.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last everything was ready. The drapery had
been taken from the windows and the pictures from
the walls; the furniture had been removed from the
rooms, which looked bare and empty enough, I
assure you. There were curtains before the doors
of the library where the tableaux were to be, and on
the piano stood the big <em>shoe</em> where Louise was to sit
and sell her three dozen dolls. There were loaves
and loaves of cake in the kitchen, which served as
the restaurant, and gallons of ice-cream in the
freezers. And all over the town the excited children
were getting ready, and watching for the sun
to set and the clock to point the hour when it was
time for them to start.</p>

It seemed a very inhospitable thing to
close the doors of one’s house, and let in
only those who paid for the admittance;
but it had been decided that such should
be the rule, and so at precisely six o’clock every
door was locked, and the boys who were to tend
them waited with an air of great importance for the
ring which was to herald the first arrival, and put
the first dime in their box. They had not long to
wait, for the children were prompt to time, and
came in groups of half-dozens, and dozens, and
scores, until the boys who kept the doors became
confused and bewildered, and gladly gave up
their post to some one who was older, and could
better stem the tide of human beings pouring in
so fast, and filling the lower rooms till there was
hardly a place to stand. It was a great jam,—the
greatest which had ever been in town. Four hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>people were present, and, in an inconceivably
short space of time, the tables upstairs were cleared,
and then the crowd came surging down to the
parlors, and gathered round the candy-table, which
was emptied in a few moments,—for the little peddlers,
Lily and Kitty and Jennie and Lena and Ada
and Emma and Nellie, did their part well, and no
one could refuse to buy when asked by so beautiful
little girls. There were pictures, too, contributed
by one of our finest artists, and these sold rapidly,
until only two were left,—one of Horace Greeley,
and another of some scene in Germany.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came the tableaux. The first, called the
“Red, White, and Blue,” was a group of three little
girls,—Lizzie, Susie, and Lulu,—each wearing a
white dress, and a sash of the color she represented,
ornamented with stars. Around them were gathered
the children,—three of whom sang the popular
air, “Red, White, and Blue,” while all joined in the
chorus,—the boys’ voices rising loud and shrill with
their “Three cheers for the Red, White, and Blue!”</p>

<p class='c011'>I wish you could have seen the next tableau,
called the “Bridal of Tom Thumb,” where Maria,
in her long tarletan dress and flowing veil, with the
orange blossoms in her hair, stood for Lavinia
Warren: and little Maggie Holmes, only three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>years old, represented Minnie,—her soft, blue eyes
looking shyly out from under their long lashes at
the people, who set up loud shouts of laughter at
the sight of the comical-looking party. There was
Wallie, as Tom Thumb, in his swallow-tailed coat,
with his white vest and white cravat, just putting
the ring on Maria’s finger; while beside him was
Little Josey Allen, similarly attired, and making the
drollest figure you ever saw, as, with his thumb in
his white vest, he stood erect and still,—making a
better Commodore than the Commodore himself,—while
Willie Campbell, in surplice made of a sheet,
was supposed to perform the ceremony. As you
may imagine, Maria and Maggie, Wallie and Josey,
were the stars of the evening; but the poor little
girls, in their long, trailing dresses, were almost as
helpless as the ladies of China are with their little
feet; and they had to be carried around in gentlemen’s
arms, and shown to the people who had been
unable to see them distinctly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Santa Claus” came next; and Mason, with his
white hair, and beard, and furs, made a capital St.
Nick, and elicited peals of laughter as he drove in
his eight reindeer, each with pasteboard horns tied
on his head, and his name pinned on his back in
large capitals. There were <span class='sc'>Dasher</span> and <span class='sc'>Dancer</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and <span class='sc'>Prancer</span> and <span class='sc'>Vixen</span>. There were <span class='sc'>Comet</span> and
<span class='sc'>Cupid</span>, and <span class='sc'>Dunder</span> and <span class='sc'>Blitzen</span>; and the little
bells about their necks made a soft, tinkling sound,
as they shook their horned heads, and pranced in
imitation of deer, while waiting for their master to
fill the sleeping children’s stockings with toys.
Then, with a bound, St. Nick sprang into his sleigh,
and the little cortege passed on through the parlor
and hall and sitting-room and dining-room, and so
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a post-office, too, and the mail was
drawn by eight little boys, with red plumes on their
heads, and driven again by Mason, who showed
great skill in the management of his horses and
reindeer. Close beside the boys ran little Sammie
Field, with the words “<span class='sc'>This-is-a-Colt</span>,” pinned on
his back; and I assure you that kicking colt
attracted quite as much attention as the eight plumed
horses did. The letters, which sold for five and ten
cents each, made a great deal of fun, and added to
the general hilarity of the evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>You should have seen Ella, dressed as an old
woman, and trying to thread the point of her needle
by a tallow candle of enormous length, and which
was called “The Light of other Days.” Louise, too,
in broad frilled cap and glasses, with her dollies all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>over her, represented the “Old Woman in the
Shoe,” and attracted crowds around her, until every
doll was sold, and the great shoe was nearly empty.
The Fish Pond was very popular, and was drained
in half an hour,—the boys and girls going nearly
crazy over it, and contending with each other for a
chance to fish, at five cents a bite. It proved a great
success, as did everything pertaining to the fair
which closed with “<span class='sc'>Johnny Schmoker</span>,” sung and
acted by the children, and a tableau arranged by the
young ladies.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was rather late when at last the fair was over,
and the children went home very tired, and a few
of them a little cross, it may be, though some were
very happy, as was proved by little black-eyed
Johnny, who had come up from Rochester, and
who, after the fair was over, and he was going to
bed, asked his mother if she did not think that
children were sometimes as happy in this world as
they would be in heaven; “Because, mother,” said
he, “I know I was as happy to-night at the fair as I
shall ever be in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the ladies, who had worked so hard and
been sometimes so disheartened, heard of that, they
felt that the fair had paid, if only in making one
child so happy. That it paid, too, in a more tangible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>form, was shown when the receipts were footed up,
and found to amount to over two hundred and
sixty dollars. You may be sure there was great rejoicing
the next day when it was known that we had
enough to get the Font, together with the bishop’s
and rector’s chairs, which we so much needed.
Means were immediately taken to have them in
readiness by Christmas, so that the children could
then present them to the church.</p>

The fair was held on the third of October,
and of all the boys there, none was
happier, or enjoyed it more, than little
Hunter Buckley, who never dreamed
that this was the last festivity in which he would
ever join with his comrades,—that before the winter
snows were falling, or the Font for which he had
worked was set up in the church, he would be
buried away from sight and sound,—where the
songs of the children could not reach him, nor the
sobs of his poor mother, who mourned so bitterly
for her little darling boy. His death was very
sudden. In the morning he was perfectly well, and
his mother little thought, when, after breakfast, he
bade her good-by, and started for the village, that
never again would his feet come down the grassy
lane, or his loved voice sound in her ears; that
when he came back to her it would be as the dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>come back,—lifeless and still. Yet so it was, for
in a few hours the news ran through the village that
Hunter Buckley was dead,—smothered in the wheat
where he was playing; and which was running
through a large tunnel into a boat loading at the
wharf. It was a careless thing to play there; but
he had done it before, and thought of no danger
now, until the suction became so great that it was
impossible to escape, and he was drawn into that
whirlpool of grain.</p>

<p class='c011'>I saw him the next day, looking, except that he
was paler, exactly as he had the Sunday before,
when he sat in Sunday school, and listened to the
lessons his teacher taught.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day was the funeral; and six young
boys carried his coffin up the aisle and laid it on the
table; while, in silence and awe, his companions
listened to the words the clergyman spoke,—words
of admonition to them,—words of commendation of
the dead,—and words of comfort for the weeping
friends, upon whom so heavy a sorrow had fallen.
Those were sad notes which the organ played then,
and more than one voice trembled as it joined in
the hymn sung over the dead boy, and then they
carried him out to the long, black hearse, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>bore him to the graveyard where Berkie had gone
before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since that time they have made another grave,
and the boys of the Sunday school have followed
Walter Hewitt there. He died when the winter
snows were heaped upon the ground, and now lies
in the same yard where Hunter and Berkie are,—three
little boys, who will sleep there in their coffins
until the resurrection morn, when Jesus comes to
claim his own and take them to himself.</p>

There was no rector in the parish that
winter; but the people kept up lay-services
and the Sunday school, and
were resolved that the children should
not go without the usual festival. So the evergreens
were brought from the lake, with a beautiful
pine-tree, and a few of the ladies worked industriously,
day after day, fashioning wreaths and crosses
and anchors, which were hung upon the walls and
festooned about the chancel, where the tree was
placed, its long branches reaching out in every
direction, as if asking for the many hundred gifts
which came pouring in so fast. There were dolls
and tops, and bows and arrows, and Christmas
cakes all sugared over the top, and stamped with
the owner’s name. There were books and cards,
and marbles and balls, and a beautiful slipper-case,
which Lulu gave to her teacher. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>boxes with candy and boxes without, and horses
and cows, and monkeys in red, and tea-kettles and
pails, and golden fishes, which gleamed so brightly
among the dark-green leaves of the tree. There
was a white ermine muff, and a picture called
the “Christmas Bell,” bought for Berkie’s mother
by her class; while, swinging in his pretty cage,
was a beautiful Canary, who, when the gas was
lighted and he had recovered a little from his fright
at being brought from the depot with a shawl over
his cage, began to look about him, and wink his
bright eyes at the children. Then, as he began to
feel more at home and to get an inkling of what it
all meant, he opened his mouth and poured forth
one sweet song after another until it seemed as if
his little throat would burst.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the handsomest gift of all was the font,
which had come the night before and been firmly
fixed in its place just outside the chancel. It was
of Italian marble, very graceful in its proportions,
and on the top, in black letters, were the words
“Presented by the children of St. Luke’s Sunday
School, Christmas, 1867,” followed by “Suffer the
little children to come unto me, and forbid them
not.” This was, of course, the center of attraction,
and both the children and the grown people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>gathered around it, commenting on its beauty, and
wondering who would be the first child baptized
from it. The new chairs, too, were there,
made of solid oak, and upholstered with crimson,
so that the church looked very handsome with its
new furniture, and the Christmas-tree, with the
tapers shining from its branches and lighting up
the hundreds of pretty things upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have told you before that we had no clergyman;
but our good doctor read a part of the evening
service, and then made a few remarks to the children,
who, I am afraid, did not listen very closely,
they were so intent upon the tree and what they
would probably get from it. Our organist had
taken great pains to drill the children in their carols,
and when they sang of “The Wonderful Night,”
we could almost see the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Angels and shining immortals</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, crowding the ebony portals.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fling out their banners of light,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a splendid carol, and if you do not already
know it, I advise you to get the “New Service
Book” and learn it before another Christmas eve.</p>

<p class='c011'>The distribution of gifts commenced at last, and
never were children happier than those who, as
their names were called, went up one after another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>to the chancel, and came back with loaded hands,
and hearts throbbing with a keener, purer delight
than they will ever know after the years of childhood
are past, and they have grown to be women
and men. The tree was stripped at last, and all
over the church there was the hum of eager, excited
voices, mingled occasionally with a blast from a
whistle or horn blown by some boy who could not
wait till he reached home before testing his musical
instrument. Then there came a hush, as the closing
prayer was said, and the grand old chant was sung
“Glory to God on high.” How the music rolled
through the church as the organ pealed its loudest
strains, and the boys and girls joined in the song,
while the little bird, frantic by this time with all it
had seen and heard, fairly shook its golden sides as
it trilled its clear, shrill notes, and mingled its own
loud voice in the last Christmas song!</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later, and the church was silent
and empty, the organ was hushed, the echo of the
singing had died away, the tree was shorn of its
decorations, the children were all at home, sleeping
many of them, and dreaming, perhaps, of that boy-baby
whose birth the angels sang, whom wise men
came to worship, and over whose cradle hovered
the shadow of the cross. But with the early dawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>I know they will awake, looking at their treasures
and living over again the joy of the preceding
night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Blessed childhood, when guarded and hedged
around with the influences which religion brings!
Which of us does not recall with a pang of regret
those halcyon days when the summer was so long
and bright because of the flowers and birds, and the
autumn so fair and sweet because of the ripening
fruits and nuts, and the winter so glorious because
of the beautiful snow? And who does not love the
children and wish to make them happy? I most
certainly do; and as, while writing this story of
The Font, the actors in the fair have one by one
passed in review before me, I have kissed and
blessed them all, and asked that God would keep
them to a green old age, when, perhaps, they may
read, with strange, curious feelings, what I have
written of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>And to the children I have never seen, but who
may read this story, I would say, I love you, too;—love
you because you are children and parts of
God’s great family, and I pray him that you may
one day meet in the better world with every one of
those who helped to buy the Font and her who
wrote its story.</p>

It was the warmest day of the season, and
from the moment when the first robin
chirped in the maple tree growing by
the door, to the time when the shadows
stretching eastward indicated that the sultry afternoon
was drawing to a close, Adam Floyd had been
busy. Indeed, he could not remember a day when
he had worked so continuously and so hard, neither
could he recall a time when he had been so perfectly
happy, except upon one starlight night when
last winter’s snow was piled upon the ground. The
events of that night had seemed to him then like a
dream, and they were scarcely more real now, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>pausing occasionally in his work and leaning his
head upon his broad, brown hands, he tried to recall
just the awkward words he had spoken and the graceful
answer she had given; answer so low that he
would hardly have known she was speaking, had
not his face been so near to hers that he could hear
the murmured response,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not half good enough for you, Adam, and
shall make a sorry wife; but, if you will take me
with all my faults, I am yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was what she had said, the only she in all
the world to Adam Floyd, now that the churchyard
grass was growing over the poor old blind mother,
to whom he had been the tenderest, best of sons,
and who had said to him when dying,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad I’m going home, my boy, for now you
can bring Anna here. She is a bonny creature, I
know by the sound of her voice and the touch of
her silky hair. Tell her how with my last breath
I blessed her, and how glad I was to think that
when she came, the old blind woman’s chair would
be empty, and that she would be spared a heavy
burden which she is far too young to bear. God
deal by her as she deals by you, my noble boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The March winds were blowing when they made
his mother’s grave, and Adam’s heart was not as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>sore now as on that dismal, rainy night, when he
first sat alone in his little cottage and missed the
groping hand feeling for his own. Anna was coming
within a week, Anna who had said, “I am not
half good enough for you.” How the remembrance
of these words even now brought a smile to the
lips where the sweat drops were standing as he
toiled for her, putting the last finishing strokes to
the home prepared for his future bride, Anna
Burroughs, the Deacon’s only daughter, the fairest
maiden in all the goodly town of Rhodes—Anna,
who had been away to school for a whole year, who
could speak another language than her own, whose
hands were soft and white as wool, whom all the
village lads coveted, and at whom it was rumored
even Herbert Dunallen the heir of Castlewild,
where Adam worked so much, had cast admiring
glances. Not good enough for him? She was far
too good for a great burly fellow like himself, a
poor mechanic, who had never looked into the
Algebras and Euclids piled on Anna’s table the
morning after she came from school. This was
what Adam thought, wondering why she had chosen
him, and if she were not sorry. Sometimes of late
he had fancied a coldness in her manner, a shrinking
from his caresses; but the very idea had made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>his great, kind heart, throb with a pang so keen
that he had striven to banish it, for to lose his darling
now would be worse than death. He had
thought it all over that August day, when he nailed
down the bright new carpet in what was to be her
room. “Our room,” he said softly to himself, as
he watched his coadjutor, old Aunt Martha Eastman,
smoothing and arranging the snowy pillows
upon the nicely made up bed, and looping with
bows of pure white satin the muslin curtains which
shaded the pretty bay window. That window was
his own handiwork. He had planned and built it
himself, for Anna was partial to bay windows. He
had heard her say so once when she came up to
Castlewild where he was making some repairs, and
so he had made her two, one in the bed-room, and
one in the pleasant parlor looking out upon the
little garden full of flowers. Adam’s taste was perfect,
and many a passer by stopped to admire the
bird’s nest cottage, peeping out from its thick covering
of ivy leaves and flowering vines. Adam was
pleased with it himself, and when the last tack had
been driven and the last chair set in its place, he
went over it alone admiring as he went, and wondering
how it would strike Anna. Would her soft
blue eyes light up with joy, or would they wear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the troubled look he had sometimes observed in
them? “If they do,” and Adam’s breath came hard
as he said it, and his hands were locked tightly together,
“If they do, I’ll lead her into mother’s
room; she won’t deceive me there. I’ll tell her
that I would not take a wife who does not love me;
that though to give her up is like tearing out my
heart, I’ll do it if she says so, and Anna will
answer——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adam did not know what, and the very possibility
that she might answer, as he sometimes feared,
paled his bronzed cheek, and made him reel, as,
walking to his blind mother’s chair, he knelt beside
it, and prayed earnestly for grace to bear the happiness
or sorrow there might be in store for him. In
early youth, Adam had learned the source of all
true peace, and now in every perplexity, however
trivial, he turned to God, who was pledged to care
for the child, trusting so implicitly in him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it is right for Anna to be mine, give her to
me, but, if she has sickened of me, oh, Father, help
me to bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Adam’s prayer, and when it was
uttered, the pain and dread were gone, and the
childlike man saw no cloud lowering on his
horizon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>It was nearly time for him to be going now, if
he would have Anna see the cottage by day-light,
and hastening to the chamber he had occupied since
he was a boy, he put on, not his wedding suit, for
that was safely locked in his trunk, but his Sunday
clothes, feeling a pardonable thrill of satisfaction
when he saw how much he was improved by dress.
Not that Adam Floyd was ever ill-looking. A
stranger would have singled him out from a thousand.
Tall, straight and firmly built, with the flush
of perfect health upon his frank, open face, and the
sparkle of intelligence in his dark brown eyes, he
represented a rare type of manly beauty. He was
looking uncommonly well, too, this afternoon, old
Martha thought, as from the kitchen door she
watched him passing down the walk and out into
the road which lead to the red farm-house, where
Deacon Burroughs lived, and where Anna was
waiting for him.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_277.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Waiting for him, we said, but not exactly
as Adam Floyd should have been waited
for. Never had a day seemed so long to
her as that which to Adam had passed so
quickly. Restless and wretched she had wandered
many times from the garden to the brook, from the
brook back to the garden, and thence to her own little
chamber, from whose window, looking southward
could be seen the chimney of the cottage, peeping
through the trees. At this she looked often and
long, trying to silence the faithful monitor within,
whispering to her of the terrible desolation which
would soon fall upon the master of that cottage, if
she persisted in her cruel plan. Then she glanced
to the northward, where, from the hill top, rose the
pretentious walls of Castlewild, whose young heir
had come between her and her affianced husband;
then she compared them, one with the other—Adam
Floyd with Herbert Dunallen—one the rich proprietor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>of Castlewild, the boyish man just of age,
who touched his hat so gracefully, as in the summer
twilight he rode in his handsome carriage past her
father’s door, the youth, whose manners were so
elegant, and whose hands were so white; the other,
a mechanic, a carpenter by trade, who worked sometimes
at Castlewild—a man unversed in etiquette as
taught in fashion’s school, and who could neither
dress, nor dance, nor flatter, nor bow as could
Dunallen, but who she knew he was tenfold more
worthy of her esteem. Alas, for Anna; though our
heroine, she was but a foolish thing, who suffered
fancy to rule her better judgment, and let her heart
turn more willingly to the picture of Dunallen than
to that of honest Adam Floyd, hastening on to join
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he were not so good,” she thought, as with a
shudder she turned away from the pretty little
work-box he had brought her; “if he had ever given
me an unkind word, or suspected how treacherous I
am, it would not seem so bad, but he trusts me so
much! Oh, Adam, I wish we had never met!” and
hiding her face in her hands, poor Anna weeps
passionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a hand upon the gate, and Anna knew
whose step it was coming so cheerfully up the walk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and wondered if it would be as light and buoyant
when she was gone. She heard him in their little
parlor, talking to her mother, and, as she listened,
the tones of his voice fell soothingly upon her ear,
for there was music in the voice of Adam Floyd, and
more than Anna had felt its quieting influence. It
seemed cruel to deceive him so dreadfully, and in
her sorrow Anna sobbed out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what must I do?” Once she thought to
pray, but she could not do that now. She had not
prayed aright since that first June night when she
met young Herbert down in the beech grove, and
heard him speak jestingly of her lover, saying “she
was far too pretty and refined for such an odd old
cove.” It had struck her then that this cognomen
was not exactly refined, that Adam Floyd would
never have called Dunallen thus, but Herbert’s arm
was round her waist, where only Adam’s had a right
to rest. Herbert’s eyes were bent fondly upon her,
and so she forgave the insult to her affianced husband,
and tried to laugh at the joke. That was the
first open act, but since then she had strayed very
far from the path of duty, until now she had half
promised to forsake Adam Floyd and be Dunallen’s
bride. That very day, just after sunset he would be
waiting in the beech wood grove for her final decision.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>No wonder that with this upon her mind
she shrank from meeting her lover, whom she knew
to be the soul of truth and honor. And yet she
must school herself to go with him over the house
he had prepared for her with so much pride and
care. Once there she would tell him, she thought,
how the love she once bore him had died out from
her heart. She would not speak of Herbert Dunallen
but she would ask to be released, and he, the
generous, unselfish man, would do her bidding.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna had faith in Adam’s goodness, and this it
was which nerved her at the last to wash the tear-stains
from her face and rearrange the golden curls
falling about her forehead. “He’ll know I’ve been
crying,” she said, “but that will pave the way to
what I have to tell him;” and with one hasty
glance at the fair young face which Adam thought
so beautiful, she ran lightly down the stairs, glad
that her mother was present when she first greeted
Adam. But the mother, remembering her own girlish
days, soon left the room, and the lovers were
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, darling? Are you sick?” and
Adam’s broad palm rested caressingly upon the
bowed head of Anna, who could not meet his earnest
glance for shame.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>She said something about being nervous and
tired because of the excessive heat, and then, steadying
her voice, she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have come for me to see the cottage, I suppose.
We will go at once, as I must return before
it’s dark,”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her manner troubled him, but he made no comment
until they were out upon the highway, when
he said to her timidly, “If you are tired, perhaps
you would not mind taking my arm. Folks will
not talk about it, now we are so near being one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna could not take his arm, so she replied:
“Somebody might gossip; I’d better walk alone,”
and coquettishly swinging the hat she carried instead
of wore, she walked by his side silently, save when
he addressed her directly. Poor Adam! there were
clouds gathering around his heart, blacker far than
the dark rift rising so rapidly in the western sky.
There was something the matter with Anna more
than weariness or heat, but he would not question
her there, and so a dead silence fell between them
until the cottage was reached, and standing with her
on the threshold of the door, he said, mournfully,
but oh! so tenderly, “Does my little Blossom like
the home I have prepared for her, and is she willing
to live here with me?”</p>

<div class='c010'>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
She seemed to him so fair, so pure, so like
the apple blossoms of early June, that
he often called her his little Blossom,
but now there was a touching pathos in
the tones of his voice as he repeated the pet name,
and it wrung from Anna a gush of tears. Lifting
her blue eyes to his for an instant, she laid her head
upon his arm and cried piteously:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adam, you are so good, so much better
than I deserve. Yes, I like it, so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it a sense of his goodness which made her
cry, or was it something else? Adam wished he
knew, but he would rather she should tell him of
her own accord, and winding his arm around her,
he lifted up her head and wiping her tears away,
kissed her gently, saying, “Does Blossom like to
have me kiss her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not, but she could not tell him so when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>he bent so fondly over her, his face all aglow with
the mighty love he bore her. Affecting not to hear
his question she broke away from his embrace and
seating herself in the bay window, began talking of
its pretty effect from the road, and the great improvement
it was to the cottage. Still she did not
deceive Adam Floyd, who all the while her playful
remarks were sounding in his ear was nerving himself
to a task he meant to perform. But not in any
of the rooms he had fitted up for her could he say
that if she would have it so she was free from him,
even though the bridal was only a week in advance
and the bridal guests were bidden. Only in one
room, his dead mother’s, could he tell her this. That
had been to him a Bethel since his blind mother left
it. Its walls had witnessed most of his secret
sorrows and his joys, and there, if it must be, he
would break his heart by giving Anna up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not change mother’s room,” he said, leading
Anna to the arm-chair where none had sat since
an aged, withered form, last rested there. “I’d
rather see it as it used to be when she was here, and
I thought you would not mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is better to leave it so,” Anna said, while
Adam continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad you like our home. I think myself it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>is pleasant, and so does every one. Even Dunallen
complimented it very highly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dunallen; has he been here?” and Anna
blushed painfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Adam was not looking at her. He had
never associated the heir of Castlewild with Anna’s
changed demeanor, and wholly unconscious of the
pain he was inflicting, he went on,
“He went all over the house this morning,
except indeed in here. I could not admit him to the
room where mother died. Did I tell you that he
had hired me for a long and profitable job? He is
going to make some repairs at Castlewild before
he brings home his bride. You know he is engaged
to a young heiress, Mildred Atherton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was well for Anna that her face was turned
from Adam as she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’ve heard something of an engagement
made by the family when he was a mere boy. I
thought perhaps he had tired of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; he told me only to-day that he expected
to bring his wife to Castlewild as early as
Christmas. We were speaking of you and our
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of me?” and Anna looked up quickly, but
poor, deluded Adam, mistook her guilty flush for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>kind of grateful pride that Dunallen should talk of
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He said you were the prettiest girl he ever saw,
and when I suggested, ‘except Miss Atherton,’ he
added, ‘I will not except any one; Milly is pretty,
but not like your <em>fiancee</em>.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna had not fallen so low that she could not
see how mean and dastardly it was for Herbert
Dunallen to talk thus of her to the very man he was
intending to wrong so cruelly; and for a moment
a life with Adam Floyd looked more desirable than
a life with Herbert Dunallen, even though it were
spent in the midst of elegance of which she had
never dreamed. Anna’s good angel was fast gaining
the ascendency, and might have triumphed had
not the sound of horse’s feet just then met her ear,
and looking from the window she saw Herbert
Dunallen riding by, his dark curls floating in the
wind and his cheek flushing with exercise. He saw
her, too, and quickly touching his cap, pointed
adroitly towards the beechwood grove. With his
disappearance over the hill her good angel flew
away, and on her face there settled the same cold,
unhappy look, which had troubled Adam so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Darling,” he said, when he spoke again, “there
is something on your mind which I do not understand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>If you are to be my wife, there should be
no secrets between us. Will you tell me what it is,
and if I can help you I will, even though—though——”</p>

<p class='c011'>His voice began to falter, for the white, hard
look on Anna’s face frightened him, and at last in
an agony of terror, he grasped both her hands in
his and added impetuously:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even though it be to give you up, you whom
I love better than my life—for whom I would die
so willingly. Oh, Anna!” and he sank on his knees
beside her, and winding his arms around her waist,
looked her imploringly in the face. “I sometimes
fear that you have sickened of me—that you shrink
from my caresses. If it is so, in mercy tell me now,
before it is too late; for, Anna, dear as you are to
me, I would rather to-morrow’s sunshine should fall
upon your grave and mine, than take you to my
bosom an unloving wife! I have worked for you,
early and late, thinking only how you might be
pleased. There is not a niche or corner in my
home that is not hallowed by thoughts of you whom
I have loved since you were a little child and I
carried you in the arms which now would be your
resting place forever. I know I am not your equal,
I feel it painfully, but I can learn with you as my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>teacher, and, my precious Anna, whatever I may
lack in polish, I <em>will</em>, I <em>will</em> make up in kindness!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was pleading now for her love, forgetting
that she was his promised wife—forgetting everything,
save that to his words of passionate appeal
there came no answering response in the expression
of her face. Only the same fixed, stony look, which
almost maddened him; it was so unlike what he
deserved and had reason to expect.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be lonely without you, Anna—more
lonely than you can guess, for there is no mother
here now to bless and cheer me as she would have
cheered me in my great sorrow. She loved you,
Anna, and blessed you with her dying breath, saying
she was glad, for your sake, that the chair where
you sit would be empty when you came, and asking
God to deal by you even as you dealt by me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Adam, Adam!” Anna gasped, for what
had been meant for a blessing rang in her ears like
that blind woman’s curse. “May God deal better
by me than I meant to deal by you!” she tried to
say, but the words died on her lips, and she could
only lay her cold hands on the shoulder of him
who still knelt before her, with his arms around
her waist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Softly, gladly came the good angel back, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>’mid a rain of tears which dropped on Adam’s hair,
Anna wept her hardness all away, while the only
sound heard in the room was the beating of two
hearts and the occasional roll of thunder muttering
in the distance. In reality it was only a few moments,
but to Anna it seemed a long, long time
that they sat thus together, her face bent down upon
his head, while she thought of all the past since she
could remember Adam Floyd and the blind old
woman, his mother. He had been a dutiful son,
Anna knew, for she had heard how tenderly he
would bear his mother in his strong arms or guide
her uncertain steps, and how at the last he sat by
her night after night, never wearying of the tiresome
vigil until it was ended, and the sightless eyes,
which in death turned lovingly to him, were opened
to the light of Heaven. To such as Adam Floyd
the commandment of promise was rife with meaning.
God would prolong his days and punish those
who wronged him. He who had been so faithful
to his mother, would be true to his wife—aye, truer
far than young Dunallen, with all his polish and
wealth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adam,” Anna began at last, so low that he
scarcely could hear her. “Adam forgive me all
that is past. I have been cold and indifferent, have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>treated you as I ought not, but I am young and
foolish, I—I—oh! Adam, I mean to do better. I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not say, “will banish Dunallen from
my mind”—it was not necessary to mention him,
she thought; but some explanation must be made,
and so, steadying her voice, she told him how dearly
she had loved him once, thinking there was not in
all the world his equal, but that during the year at
a city school she had acquired some foolish notions
and had sometimes wished her lover different.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not better at heart. You could not be that,”
she said, looking him now fully in the face, for she
was conscious of meaning what she said, “but—but—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not finish it, darling; I know what
you mean,” Adam said, the cloud lifting in a measure
from his brow. “I am not refined one bit, but my
Blossom is, and she shall teach me. I will try hard
to learn. I will not often make her ashamed. I
will even imitate <em>Dunallen</em>, if that will gratify my
darling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Why would he keep bringing in that name, when
the sound of it was so like a dagger to Anna’s heart,
and when she wished she might never hear it again?
He was waiting for her now in the beech woods she
knew, for she was to join him there ere long, not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>say what she would have said an hour ago, but to
say that she could not, would not wrong the noble
man who held her to his bosom so lovingly as he
promised to copy <em>Dunallen</em>. And as Anna suffered
him to caress her, she felt her olden love coming
back. She should be happy with him—happier far
than if she were the mistress of Castlewild, and
knew that to attain that honor she had broken
Adam’s heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As a proof that you trust me fully,” she said,
as the twilight shadows deepened around them,
“you must let me go home alone, I wish it for a
special reason. You must not tell me no,” and the
pretty lips touched his bearded cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>Adam wanted to walk with her down the pleasant
road, where they had walked so often, but he saw she
was in earnest, and so he suffered her to depart
alone, watching her until the flutter of her light
dress was lost to view. Then kneeling by the chair
where she had sat so recently, he asked that the cup
of joy, placed again in his eager hand, might not be
wrested from him, that he might prove worthy of
Anna’s love, and that no cloud should ever again
come between them.</p>

Herbert Dunallen had waited there
a long time, as he thought, and he began
to grow impatient. What business had
Anna to stay with that old fellow, if she
did not mean to have him, and of course she did
not. It would be a most preposterous piece of
business for a girl like Anna to throw herself away
upon such as Adam Floyd, carpenter by trade, and
general repairer of things at Castlewild. Whew-ew!
and Herbert whistled contemptuously, adding
in a low voice, “and yet my lady mother would raise
a beautiful rumpus if she knew I was about to make
this little village rustic her daughter-in-law. For I
am; if there’s one redeeming trait in my character,
it’s being honorable in my intentions toward Anna.
Most men in my position would only trifle with her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>particularly when there was in the background a
Mildred Atherton, dreadfully in love with them. I
wonder what makes all the girls admire me so?” and
the vain young man stroked his mustache complacently,
just as a rapid footstep sounded near.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Anna’s, and the next moment he held her
in his arms. But she would not suffer him to keep
her there, and with a quiet dignity which for an instant
startled him beyond the power to speak or act,
she put his arm away, and standing apart from him,
told him of her resolution, and reproached him with
his duplicity, asking him how he could tell Adam
that he was about to be married.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I am,” he replied. “I am not to blame
for his believing silly little Milly to be the bride
elect. Won’t it be famous, though, for you to order
round your former lover? I’ve engaged him
for a long job, and you ought to have seen how
glad he was of the work, thinking, of course, how
much he should earn for you. I came near laughing
in his face when he hoped I should be as happy
with Miss Mildred as he expected to be with
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shan’t speak so of Adam Floyd!” and
Anna’s little foot beat the ground impatiently, while
indignant tears glittered in her blue eyes as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>again reiterated that Adam Floyd should be her
husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not while I live!” Herbert responded almost
fiercely, for he saw in her manner a determination
he had never witnessed before.</p>

<p class='c011'>As well as he was capable of doing he loved
Anna Burroughs, and the fact that she was pledged
to another added fuel to the flame.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What new freak has taken my fickle goddess?”
he asked, looking down upon her with a mocking
sneer about his mouth as she told him why she
could not go with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew she was in earnest at last, and, dropping
his jesting tone, he made her sit down beside
him, while he used every possible argument to dissuade
her from her purpose, working first upon her
pride, flattering her vanity, portraying the happiness
of a tour through Europe, a winter in Paris,
and lastly touching upon the advantages of being
lady supreme at Castlewild, with a house in the
city, for winter. And as changeable, ambitious,
Anna listened, she felt her resolution giving way,
felt the ground which she had taken slipping from
beneath her feet without one effort to save herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems terrible to wrong Adam,” she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>and, by the tone of her voice, Herbert knew the victory
was two thirds won.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Adam will do well enough,” he replied. “People
like him never die of broken hearts! He’s a
good fellow, but not the one for you; besides, you
know he’s what they call pious, just like Milly;
and, I presume, he’ll say it was not so wicked for
you to cheat him as to perjure yourself, as you surely
would, by promising to love and honor and all
that when you didn’t feel a bit of it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was that you said of Miss Atherton?”
Anna asked eagerly, for she had caught the word
pious, and it made her heart throb with pain, for
she knew that Herbert Dunallen could not say as
much of her!</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, indeed, it had been otherwise, but that was
before she had met him in the woods,—before she
ceased to pray. Oh, that happy time when she had
dared to pray! How she wished it would come
back to her again; but it had drifted far away, and
left a void as black as the night closing around her
or the heavy thunder clouds rolling above her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tightly her hands clenched each other as Herbert
answered jestingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s one of the religious ones, Milly is; writes
me such good letters. I’ve one of them in my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>pocket now. She’s coming to see me; is actually
on the way, so to-morrow night, or never, my
bride you must be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Atherton coming here! What do you
mean?” Anna asked, and Herbert replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean, Mildred has always been in a fever to
see Castlewild, and as she is intimate with Mrs.
Judge Harcourt’s family, she is coming there on a
visit. Will arrive to-morrow, her note said; and
will expect to see me immediately after her arrival.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Herbert’s influence over Anna was too great
for her to attempt to stop him, so she offered no
remonstrance, when he continued!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose Milly will cry a little, for I do believe
she likes me, and always has; but I can’t help
it. The match was agreed upon by our families
when she was twelve and I fifteen. Of course I’m
awfully sick of it, and have been ever since I knew
you,” and Herbert’s lips touched the white brow
where only half an hour before Adam Floyd’s had
been.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thicker, and blacker, grew the darkness around
them, while the thunder was louder and nearer, and
still they sat together, Anna hesitating, while
Herbert urged upon her the necessity of going with
him the following night, if ever.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Mildred in the neighborhood would be as formidable
an obstacle to him as Adam was to Anna, while
he feared the result of another interview between
the affianced pair. With all his love for Anna he
was not blind to the fact that the last one with
whom she talked had the better chance of eventually
winning. He could not lose her now, and he
redoubled his powers of persuasion, until, forgetting
everything, save the handsome youth beside
her, the wealthy heir of Castlewild, Anna said to
him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will meet you at our gate when the village
clock strikes one!” and as she said the words
the woods were lighted up by a flash of lightning
so fearfully bright and blinding that with
a scream of terror she hid her face in her lap and
stopped her ears to shut out the deafening roll of
the thunder. The storm had burst in all its fury,
and hurrying from the woods, Herbert half carried,
half led the frightened Anna across the fields in
the direction of her father’s door. Depositing her
at the gate, he paused for an instant to whisper his
parting words and then hastened rapidly on.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the kitchen hearth a cheerful wood fire had
been kindled, and making some faint excuse for
having been out in the storm, Anna repaired thither,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and standing before the blaze was drying her dripping
garments, when a voice from the adjoining
room made her start and tremble, for she knew that
it was Adam’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to be excited and was asking for her.
An accident had occurred just before his door.
Frightened by the lightning which Anna remembered
so well, a pair of spirited horses had upset a
traveling carriage, in which was a young lady and
her maid. The latter had sustained no injury, but
the lady’s ankle was sprained, and she was otherwise
so lamed and bruised that it was impossible for her
to proceed any farther that night. So he had
carried her into his cottage and dispatching the
driver for the physician had come himself for Anna
as the suitable person to play the hostess in his home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can’t go,—mother, you!” Anna exclaimed,
shrinking in terror from again crossing the threshold
of the home she was about to make so desolate.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Adam preferred Anna. The lady was young,
he said, and it seemed to him more appropriate that
Anna should attend her. Mrs. Burroughs thought
so, too, and, with a sinking heart, Anna prepared
herself for a second visit to the cottage. In her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>excitement she forgot entirely to ask the name of
the stranger, and as she was not disposed to talk,
nothing was said of the lady until the cottage was
reached and she was ushered into the dining-room,
where old Martha and a smart looking servant were
busy with the bandages and hot water preparing
for the invalid who had been carried to the pleasant
bed-room opening from the parlor.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_299.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
“How is Miss Atherton?” Adam asked of
Martha, while he kindly attempted to
assist Anna in removing the heavy
shawl her mother had wrapped around
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who? What did you call her?” Anna asked,
her hands dropping helplessly at her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I thought I told you. I surely did your
mother. I beg pardon for my carelessness. It’s
Mildred Atherton,” and Adam’s voice sank to a
whisper. “She was on her way to visit Mrs. Harcourt.
I suppose it would be well to send for
Dunallen, but I thought it hardly proper for me to
suggest it. I’ll let you get at it somehow, and see
if she wants him. You girls have a way of understanding
each other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Knowing how, in similar circumstances, he
should yearn for Anna’s presence, Adam had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>deemed it natural that Mildred’s first wish would be
for Herbert, and one reason for his insisting that
Anna should come back with him was the feeling
that the beautiful girl, whose face had interested
him at once, would be more free to communicate
her wishes to one of her own age.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mildred Atherton,” Anna kept repeating to
herself, every vestige of color fading from her
cheeks and lips, as she wondered how she could
meet her, or what the result of the meeting would
be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sarah, where are you? Has everybody left
me?” came from the bed, where the outline of a
girlish form was plainly discernible to Anna, who
started at the tones of what seemed to her the sweetest
voice she had ever heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to her,” Adam whispered, and Anna
mechanically obeyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gliding to the bedside, she stood a moment
gazing upon the beautiful face nestled among the
snowy pillows. The eyes were closed, and the long,
silken lashes shaded the fair, round cheek, not one
half so white as Anna’s, notwithstanding that a
spasm of pain occasionally distorted the regular
features, and wrung a faint cry from the pretty lips.
Masses of soft black curls were pushed back from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the forehead, and one hand lay outside the counterpane,
a little soft, fat hand, on whose fourth finger
shone the engagement ring, the seal of her betrothal
to the heir of Castlewild! Oh, how debased and
wicked Anna felt standing by that innocent girl,
and how she marveled that having known Mildred
Atherton, Herbert Dunallen could ever have turned
to her. Involuntarily a sigh escaped her lips, and
at the sound the soft black eyes unclosed, and looked
at her wonderingly. Then a smile broke over the
fair face, and extending her hand to Anna, Mildred
said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where am I? My head feels so confused. I
remember the horses reared when that flash of
lightning came, the carriage was overturned, and
some young man, who seemed a second Apollo in
strength and beauty, brought me in somewhere so
gently and carefully, that I could have hugged him
for it, he was so good. Are you his sister!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I am Anna Burroughs. He came for me,”
Anna replied, and looking her full in the face,
Mildred continued,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I remember now, his nurse or housekeeper
told me he had gone for the girl who was to be his
wife; and you are she. It’s pleasant to be engaged,
isn’t it?” and Mildred’s hand gave Anna’s a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>confidential squeeze, which, quite as much as the
words she had uttered, showed how affectionate and
confiding was her disposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The entrance of the physician put an end to the
conversation, and withdrawing to a little distance
where in the shadow she could not be well observed
Anna stood while the doctor examined the swollen
ankle, and his volatile patient explained to him in
detail how it all happened, making herself out quite
a heroine for courage and presence of mind, asking
if he knew Mrs. Harcourt, and if next morning he
would not be kind enough to let her know that
Mildred Atherton was at the cottage. The doctor
promised whatever she asked, and was about to leave
the room, when Adam stepped forward and said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any one else whom Miss Atherton
would like to see—any friend in the neighborhood
who ought to be informed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Eagerly Anna waited for the answer, watching
half jealously the crimson flush stealing over Mildred’s
face, as she replied,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not to-night; it would do no good; to-morrow
is soon enough. I never like to make unnecessary
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The head which had been raised while Mildred
spoke to Adam lay back upon the pillow, but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>until with a second thought the sweet voice had said
to him,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thank you, sir, you are so kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a creature of impulse, Anna felt a passing
thrill of something like pride in Adam as Mildred
Atherton spoke thus to him, and when as he passed
her he involuntarily laid his hand a moment on her
shoulder she did not shake it off, though her heart
throbbed painfully with thoughts of her intended
treachery. They were alone now, Mildred and
Anna, and beckoning the latter to her side, Mildred
said to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He meant Herbert Dunallen. How did he
know that I am to be Herbert’s wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no tremor in her voice. She spoke
of Herbert as a matter of course, while Anna could
hardly find courage to reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Floyd works at Castlewild sometimes, and
probably has heard Mr. Dunallen speak of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Floyd—Adam Floyd, is that the young
man’s name?” was Mildred’s next question, and
when Anna answered in the affirmative, she continued,
“I have heard of him. Herbert wrote how
invaluable he was and how superior to most
mechanics—his prime minister in fact. I am glad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the accident happened here, and Herbert too will
be glad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Mildred seemed to be thinking,
then starting up, she said, abruptly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it was Anna—Anna Burroughs, yes, I’m
sure that’s the name. Would you mind putting
that lamp nearer to me, and coming yourself where
I can see just how you look?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna shrank from the gaze of those clear, truthful
eyes, but something in Mildred’s manner impelled
her to do as she was requested, and moving
the lamp she came so near that Mildred placed a
hand on either side of her burning face and gazed
at it curiously; then, pushing back the golden hair,
and twining one of the curls a moment about her
finger, she laid it by her own long, black shining
tresses, saying sadly, “I wish my curls were light
and fair like yours. It would suit Herbert better.
He fancies a blonde more than a brunette, at least
he told me as much that time he wrote to me of
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of me?” Anna asked anxiously, the color receding
from her cheek and lip. “Why did he write
of me, and when?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The dark eyes were shut now and Anna could
see the closed lids quiver, just as did the sweet voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>which replied, “It’s strange to talk so openly to you
as if we were dear friends, as we will be when I
come to Castlewild to live. It is my nature to say
right out what I think, and people sometimes call
me silly. Herbert does, but I don’t care. When
I like a person I show it, and I like you. Besides,
there’s something tells me there is a bond of
sympathy between us greater than between ordinary
strangers. I guess it is because we are both engaged,
both so young, and both rather pretty, too.
You certainly are, and I know I am not bad looking,
if Aunt Theo. did use to try and make me think I
was. Her story and the mirror’s did not agree.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna looked up amazed at this frank avowal,
which few would ever have made, even though in
their hearts they were far vainer of their beauty
than was Mildred Atherton of hers. Was she really
silly, or was she wholly artless and childlike in her
manner of expression? Anna could not decide,
and with a growing interest in the stranger, she
listened while Mildred went on: “In one of his
letters last May Herbert said so much of Anna
Burroughs, with her eyes of blue and golden hair,
calling her a ‘Lily of the Valley,’ and asking, all
in play, you know, if I should feel very badly if he
should elope some day with his Lily. It shocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>you, don’t it!” she said, as Anna started with a
sudden exclamation, “But he did not mean it. He
only tried to tease me, and for a time it did make
in my heart a little round spot of pain which burned
like fire, for though Herbert has some bad habits
and naughty ways, I love him very dearly. He is
always better with me. He says I do him good,
though he calls me a puritan, and that time when
the burning spot was in my heart, I used to go away
and pray, that if Herbert did not like me as he
ought, God would incline him to do so. Once I
prayed for you, whom I had never seen,” and the
little soft hand stole up to Anna’s bowed head
smoothing the golden locks caressingly, “You’ll
think me foolish, but thoughts of you really troubled
me then, when I was weak and nervous, for I was
just recovering from sickness, and so I prayed that
the Lily of the Valley might not care for Herbert,
might not come between us, and I know God heard
me just as well as if it had been my own father of
whom I asked a favor. Perhaps it is not having
any father or mother which makes me take every
little trouble to God. Do you do so, Anna? Do
you tell all your cares to him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alas for conscience-stricken Anna, who had not
prayed for so very, very long! What could she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>say? Nothing, except to dash the bitter tears from
her eyes and answer, sobbingly,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I used to do so once, but now—oh, Miss
Atherton! now I am so hard, so wicked, I dare not
pray!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In great perplexity Mildred looked at her a
moment, and then said, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just because I was hard and wicked, I should
want to pray—to ask that if I had done anything
bad I might be forgiven, or if I had intended to do
wrong, I might be kept from doing it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mildred little guessed how keen a pang her
words “or <em>intended</em> to do wrong” inflicted upon the
repenting Anna, who involuntarily stretched her
hands toward the young girl as towards something
which, if she did but grasp it, would save her from
herself. Mildred took the hands between her own,
and pressing them gently, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know why you feel so badly, neither
can I understand how anything save sin can make
you unhappy when that good man is almost your
husband. You must love him very much, do you
not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” came faintly from Anna’s lips, and laying
her face on the pillow beside Mildred’s, she
murmured, inaudibly: “God help me, and forgive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>that falsehood, I will love him, if I do not
now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Anna did not know she prayed, but He who
understands our faintest desire knew it, and from
that moment dated her return to duty. She
should not wrong that gentle, trusting girl. She
could not break Milly’s heart with Adam’s as break
it she surely should if her wicked course were
persisted in. And then there flashed upon her the
conviction that Herbert had deceived her in more
ways than one. He had represented Mildred as
tiring of the engagement as well as himself—had
said that though her pride might be a little wounded,
she would on the whole be glad to be rid of him so
easily, and all the while he knew that what he said
was false. Would he deal less deceitfully by her
when the novelty of calling her his wife had worn
away? Would he not weary of her and sigh for the
victim sacrificed so cruelly? Anna’s head and
heart both seemed bursting with pain, and when
Mildred, alarmed at the pallor of her face, asked
if she were ill, there was no falsehood in the reply,
“Yes, I’m dizzy and faint—I cannot stay here
longer,” and scarcely conscious of what she was
doing, Anna quitted the room, leaning for support
against the banisters in the hall and almost falling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>against old Martha who was carrying hot tea to
Mildred Atherton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me go home, I am sick,” Anna whispered
to Adam, who, summoned by Martha, bent anxiously
over her, asking what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was too late to go home, he said. She must
stay there till morning; and very tenderly he helped
her up to the chamber she was to occupy, the one
next to his own, and from which, at a late hour, she
heard him, as, thinking her asleep, he thanked his
Heavenly Father for giving her to him, and asked
that he might be more worthy of her than he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Adam, oh, no—pray that I may be more
worthy of you,” trembled on Anna’s lips, and then
lest her resolution might fail, she arose and striking
a light, tore a blank leaf from a book lying on a
table, and wrote to Herbert Dunallen that she could
never meet him again, except as a friend and the
future husband of Mildred Atherton.</p>

<p class='c011'>Folding it once over, she wrote his name upon
it, then, faint with excitement, and shivering with
cold, threw herself upon the outside of the bed, and
sobbed herself into a heavy sleep, more exhausting
in its effects than wakefulness would have been.</p>

There was another patient for the village
doctor, besides Mildred, at the cottage
next morning. Indeed, <em>her</em> case sank
into insignificance when compared with
that of the moaning, tossing, delirious Anna, who
shrank away from Adam, begging him not to touch
her, for she was not worthy.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had found her just after sunrise, and sent
for her mother, whose first thought was to take her
home; but Anna resisted at once; she must stay
there she said, and expiate her sin, in Adam’s house.
Then, looking, into her mother’s face, she added
with a smile,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know it was to have been mine in a week!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Adam did not see the smile. He only heard the
words, and his heart beat quickly as he thought it
natural that Anna should wish to stay in what was
to be her home.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The hot August sun came pouring into the
small, low room she occupied, making it so uncomfortable,
that Adam said she must be moved, and
taking her in his arms he carried her down the
stairs, and laid her upon the bridal bed, whose
snowy drapery was scarcely whiter than was her
face, save where the fever burned upon her fair skin.
On the carpet where it had fallen he found the
crumpled note. He knew it was her writing, and
he looked curiously at the name upon it, while
there stole over him a shadowy suspicion, as to the
cause of Anna’s recent coldness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Herbert Dunallen!” He read the name with
a shudder, and then thrust the note into his pocket
until the young man came.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how he longed to read the note and know
what his affianced bride had written to Dunallen;
but not for the world would he have opened it, and
Anna’s secret was safe, unless she betrayed it in her
delirium, as she seemed likely to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>A messenger had been dispatched to Castlewild,
informing its young heir of Mildred Atherton’s
mishap. In the room he called his library, Herbert
sat, arranging his papers, and writing some directions
for his head man of business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something from Adam Floyd,” he exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>as he tore open the envelope, “Oh, bother,” was all
the comment he made, as he read the hastily written
lines, which gave no hint of Anna’s sudden illness.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not in the least prepared for that, and the
sudden paling of his cheek when, on his arrival at the
cottage, he heard of it, did not escape the watchful
Adam, who quietly handed him the note, explaining
where he had found it, and then went back to Anna,
in whose great blue eyes there was a look of fear
whenever they met his—a look which added to the
dull, heavy pain gnawing at his heart. He did not
see Herbert when he read Anna’s note—did not hear
his muttered curse at woman’s fickleness, but he
saw the tiny fragments into which it was torn,
flutter past the window where he sat by Anna’s
side. One, a longer strip than the others, fell upon
the window sill, and Adam picked it up, reading
involuntarily the words “Your unhappy Anna.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Down in the depths of Adam’s heart there was a
sob, a moan of anguish as his fears were thus corroborated,
but his face gave no token of the fierce
pain within. It was just as calm as ever, when it
turned again to Anna who was talking in her sleep,
first of Herbert and then of Adam, begging him to
forget that he ever knew the little girl called Anna
Burroughs, or carried her over the rifts of snow to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the school-house under the hill. It seemed strange
that she should grow sick so fast when yesterday
she had been comparatively well, but the sudden
cold she had taken the previous night, added to the
strong excitement under which she had been laboring,
combined to spend the energies of a constitution
never strong, and the fever increased so rapidly
that before the close of the second day more than
one heart throbbed with fear as to what the end
would be.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of her lame ankle Mildred had managed
to get into the sick-room, urging Herbert to accompany
her, and feeling greatly shocked at his reply
that “camphor and medicine were not to his taste.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Herbert had not greeted his bride elect very
lovingly, for to her untimely appearance he attributed
Anna’s illness and decision. He could change
the latter he knew, only give him the chance, but
the former troubled him greatly. Anna might die,
and then—Herbert Dunallen did not know what
then, but bad as he was he would rather she should
not die with all that sin against Adam unconfessed,
and out in the beech woods where the night before
he had planned with her their flight, and where after
leaving Mildred he repaired, he laid his boyish head
upon the summer grass and <em>cried</em>, partly as a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>would cry for the bauble denied, partly as an honest
man might mourn for the loved one whose life he
had helped to shorten.</p>

<p class='c011'>Regularly each morning the black pony from
Castlewild was tied at the cottage gate, while its
owner made inquiry for Anna. He had discernment
enough to see that from the first his visits
were unwelcome to Adam Floyd, who he believed
knew the contents of the note written him by Anna.
But in this last he was mistaken. All Adam knew
certainly was gathered from Anna’s delirious ravings,
which came at last to be understood by
Mildred, who in spite of Mrs. Judge Harcourt’s
entreaties or those of her tall, handsome son,
George Harcourt, just home from Harvard, persisted
in staying at the cottage and ministering to
Anna. For a time the soft black eyes of sweet
Mildred Atherton were heavy with unshed tears,
while the sorrow of a wounded, deceived heart was
visible upon her face; but at length her true
womanly sense of right rose above it all, and waking
as if from a dream she saw how utterly unworthy
even of her childish love was the <em>boy man</em>,
whose society she shunned, until, irritated by her
manner, he one day demanded an explanation of
her coolness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“You know, Herbert,” and Milly’s clear, innocent
eyes looked steadily into his. “You know far
better than I, all that has passed between you and
Anna Burroughs. To me and her lover, noble
Adam Floyd, it is known only in part, but you understand
the whole, and I am glad of this opportunity
to tell you that you are free from an engagement
which never should have been made, and of
which you are weary. I did love you so much
Herbert, even though I knew that you were wayward.
I loved you, and prayed for you, too, every
morning and every night. I shall do that yet,
wherever you are, but henceforth we are friends,
and nothing more. Seek forgiveness, first of God,
and then of Adam Floyd, whom you thought to
wrong by wresting from him the little ewe-lamb,
which was his all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Herbert looked up quickly. Wholly unversed
in Scripture, the <em>ewe-lamb</em> was Greek to him, but
Mildred was too much in earnest for him to jest.
She had never seemed so desirable as now, that he
had lost her, and grasping her hand from which she
was taking the engagement ring, he begged of her
to wait, to consider, before she cast him off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was mean with Anna, I know, and I meant to
run away with her, but that is over now. Speak to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>me, Milly; I do not know you in this new character.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Milly hardly knew herself, but with regard to
Herbert she was firm, giving him no hope of ever
recovering the love he had wantonly thrown away.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that interview, the black pony stayed
quietly in its stable at Castlewild, while Herbert
shut himself up in his room, sometimes crying when
he thought of Anna, sometimes swearing when he
thought of Mildred, and ending every reverie with
his pet words, “oh botheration.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Each morning, however, a servant was sent to
the cottage where, for weeks, Anna hovered between
life and death, carefully tended by her mother and
Mildred Atherton, and tenderly watched by Adam,
who deported himself toward her as a fond parent
would toward its erring but suffering child. There
was no bitterness in Adam’s heart, nothing save love
and pity for the white-faced girl, whom he held firmly
in his arms, soothing her gently, while Mildred cut
away the long, golden tresses, at which, in her wild
moods, she clutched so angrily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor shorn lamb,” he whispered, while his
tears, large and warm, dropped upon the wasted
face he had not kissed since the night he and Mildred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>watched with her and heard so much of the
sad story.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for the help which cometh only from on
high, Adam’s heart would have broken, those long
bright September days, when everything seemed to
mock his woe. It was so different from what he
had hoped when he built castles of the Autumn time,
when Anna would be with him. She was there, it
is true; there in the room he had called <em>ours</em>, but
was as surely lost to him, he said, as if the bright-hued
flowers were blossoming above her grave. She
did not love him, else she had never purposed to
deceive him, and he looked drearily forward to the
time when he must again take up his solitary life,
uncheered by one hope in the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>She awoke to consciousness at last. It was in
the grey dawn of the morning, when Adam was
sitting by her, while her mother and Mildred rested
in the adjoining room. Eagerly she seemed to be
searching for something, and when Adam asked for
what, she answered: “The note; I had it in my
hand when I went to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bending over her, Adam said: “I found it; I
gave it to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a perceptible start, a flushing of
Anna’s cheek and a frightened, half pleading look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>in her eyes; but she asked no questions, and thinking
she would rather not have him there, Adam
went quietly out to her mother with the good news
of Anna’s consciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Days went by after that, days of slow convalescence;
but now that he was no longer needed in the
sick-room, Adam stayed away. Tokens of his
thoughtful care, however, were visible everywhere,
in the tasteful bouquets arranged each morning, just
as he knew Anna liked them—in the luscious fruit
and tempting delicacies procured by him for the
weak invalid who at last asked Mildred to call him
and leave them alone together.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first there was much constraint on either side,
but at last Anna burst out impetuously, “Oh,
Adam, I do not know what I said in my delirium,
or how much you know, and so I must tell you
everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as rapidly as possible and without excusing
herself in the least, she told her story and what
she had intended to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Adam did not speak, and when he
did it was to ask if Mildred had told her about
Herbert. But his name had not been mentioned
between the two girls and thus it devolved upon
Adam to explain. Herbert had left the neighborhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>and gone abroad immediately after Anna’s
convalescence was a settled thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps he will soon come back,” Adam said,
and Anna cried, “Oh, Adam, I never wish him to
return, I know now that I never loved him as—I—oh,
I wish I had died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were not prepared, and God spared you
to us. We are very glad to have you back,” Adam
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>These were the first words he had spoken which
had in them anything like his former manner, and
Anna involuntarily stretched her hand toward him.
He took it, and letting it rest on his broad, warm
palm, smoothed it a little as he would have
smoothed a little child’s, but what Anna longed to
hear was not spoken, and in a tremor of pain she
sobbed out,</p>

<p class='c011'>“In mercy, speak to me once as you used to.
Say that you forgive me, even though we never can
be to each other again what we have been!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do forgive you, Anna; and as for the rest I
did not suppose you wished it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Raising herself up, Anna threw her arms impetuously
around his neck, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do wish it, Adam. Don’t cast me off. Try
me, and see if I am not worthy. I have sinned, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>I have repented too. Never were you so dear to
me! Oh, Adam, take me back!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was getting too much excited, and putting
her arms from his neck, Adam laid her upon the
pillow, and said to her gently,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anna, my faith in you has been shaken, but
my love has never changed. You must not talk
longer now. I’ll come again by and by, and meantime
I’ll send Miss Atherton. She knows it all,
both from Herbert and yourself. She is a noble
girl. You can trust her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At Adam’s request Mildred went to Anna, and
sitting down beside her, listened while Anna confessed
the past, even to the particulars of her interview
with Adam, and then added tearfully,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, and tell me what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should be an unworthy disciple of Him who
said forgive, until seventy times seven, if I refused
your request,” was Mildred’s reply, as she wound
her arm around Anna’s neck, and imprinted upon
Anna’s lips the kiss of pardon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as Anna could bear it, she unfolded her
plan, which was that the invalid should return with
her to her pleasant home at Rose Hill, staying there
until she had fully tested the strength of her love
for Adam, who, if she stood the test should come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>for her himself. As a change of air and scene
seemed desirable, Anna’s mother raised no serious
objection to this arrangement, and so one October
morning Adam Floyd held for a moment a little
wasted hand in his while he said good-bye to its
owner, who so long as he was in sight leaned from
the carriage window to look at him standing there
so lone and solitary, yet knowing it was better to
part with her awhile, if he would have their future
as bright as he had once fancied it would be.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c011'>Eight years have passed away, and on the broad
piazza of Castlewild a sweet-faced woman stands,
waiting impatiently the arrival of the carriage
winding slowly up the hill, and which stops at last,
while Mildred Atherton alights from it and ascends
the steps to where Anna stands waiting for her.
And Mildred, who for years has been abroad, and
has but recently returned to America, has come to
be for a few weeks her guest, and to see how Anna
deports herself as the wife of Adam Floyd, and
mistress of beautiful Castlewild.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a sad story connected with Anna’s being
there at Castlewild, a story which only Mildred can
tell, and in the dusky twilight of that first evening
when Adam was away and the baby Milly asleep in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>its crib, she takes Anna’s hand in hers and tells her
what Anna indeed knew before, but which seems
far more real as it comes from Mildred’s lips,
making the tears fall fast as she listens to it. Tells
her how Providence directed her to the room in a
Paris hotel, where a fellow countryman lay dying,
alone and unattended save by a hired nurse. The
sick room was on the same hall with her own, and
in passing the door which was ajar, she was startled
to hear a voice once familiar to her and which
seemed to call her name. Five minutes later and
she was sitting by Herbert Dunallen’s bedside and
holding his burning hands in hers, while he told her
how long he had lain there with the fever contracted
in the south of France, and how at the moment she
passed his door he was crying out in his anguish
and desolation for the friends so far away, and had
spoken her name, not knowing she was so near.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that Milly was his constant attendant, and
once when she sat by him he talked to her of the
past and of Anna, who had been three years the wife
of Adam Floyd.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad of it,” he said. “She is happier
with him than she could have been with me. I am
sorry that I ever came between them, it was more
my fault than hers, and I have told Adam so. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>wrote him from Algiers and asked his forgiveness,
and he answered my letter like the noble man he is.
There is peace between us now, and I am glad. I
have heard from him, or rather of him since, in a
roundabout away. He lost his right arm in the
war, and that will incapacitate him from his work.
He can never use the hammer again. I do not suppose
he has so very much money. Anna liked
Castlewild. In fact I believe she cared more for
that than for me, and I have given it to her;—have
made my will to that effect. It is with my other
papers, and Milly, when I am dead, you will see that
Anna has her own. I did not think it would come
quite so soon, for I am young to die. Not thirty
yet, but it is better so, perhaps. You told me that
you prayed for me every day, and the memory of
that has stuck to me like a burr, till I have prayed
for myself, more than once, when I was well, and
often since shut up in this room which I shall never
leave alive. Stay by me, Milly, to the last; it will
not be long, and pray that if I am not right, God
will make me so. Show me the way, Milly, I want
to be good, I am sorry, oh, so sorry for it all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few days longer he lingered, and then one
lovely autumnal morning, when Paris was looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>her brightest, he died, with Milly’s hand in his, and
Milly’s tears upon his brow.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so Castlewild came to Anna, who had been
three years its mistress when Milly came to visit
her, and on whose married life no shadow however
small had fallen, except, indeed, the shadows which
are common to the lives of all. When her husband
came home from the war a cripple, as he told her with
quivering lips, her tears fell like rain for him, because
he was sorry, but for herself she did not care; he
was left to her, and kissing him lovingly she promised
to be his right arm and to work for him if
necessary, even to building houses, if he would
teach her how. But poverty never came to Adam
Floyd and Anna, and probably never would have
come, even if there had been no will which left
them Castlewild. That was a great surprise, and at
first Adam hesitated about going there. But Anna
persuaded him at last, and there we leave them, perfectly
happy in each other’s love, and both the better,
perhaps, for the grief and pain which came to them
in their youth.</p>

My wife was Priscilla Lord, daughter of the
Hon. Erastus Lord, but I always call her
Cilly for short, and she rather likes that
pet name, inasmuch as it is not spelled
with an S. We had been married and kept house
ten years, and it had never occurred to me that we
were not as comfortable, and cozy, and happy as
our neighbors, until one Saturday night in the
month of May, when I was superintending the packing
of my shirts, and socks, and neckties, preparatory
to a business trip which I was to make for the
firm which employed me, and which was to last four
weeks positively, if not longer. Then, after sewing
on the last button, and darning the last sock, and
wondering why men always wore out their heels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>and toes so fast, Cilly suddenly informed me that
we were neither cozy nor comfortable, nor respectable,

<p class='c011'>I was taking off my boots, and sat staring at her
with one uplifted in the air, while she went on to
say that the view from our bed-room was just horrid,
looking out upon nothing but a lane, and a board
fence, and Mrs. Patterson’s kitchen—that we had no
china closet proper at all, which was a shame for
people of our means—that we had to pass through
the dining-room to go down cellar, which was a
great inconvenience—that we had no conservatory,
and the bay window was always crowded with
plants in the winter, giving a littered appearance to
the room—that the west piazza was altogether too
short a walk for her mother, who had lived with us
for the past year, and who needed a longer promenade,
especially in bad weather. And she continued
to inform me further that there was space for such
a nice room in the attic, which we really needed in
the summer when the house was full, and Lizzie was
there with all her children and the nurse.</p>

<p class='c011'>I liked Lizzie, and liked the children, and liked
to have them with us, especially as there were no
little Logans of my own playing in the yard; but
I thought three spare rooms ought to be enough for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>them, until I reflected that my mother-in-law, Mrs.
Erastus Lord, now occupied one of the spare rooms,
leaving a surplus of only two, so I still kept silent
until Cilly, thinking she had succeeded in convincing
me that of all tucked-up, inconvenient, disreputable
houses in town, ours was the worst, went on
to say that she thought and her mother thought, and
her grandma thought, (grandma was the old Mrs.
Lord of all, Mrs. Erastus, senior,) that we ought to
“go through a set of repairs;” I think that’s the way
she worded it, and as brother John had left her two
thousand dollars “<em>to do just exactly what she pleased
with</em>” she had made up her mind to repair, and was
going to do it while I was away, so as to save me all
the trouble of the muss, and—and—Cilly got a
little confused here and stammered a good deal, and
finally went on rapidly: “You see, I have quite
decided, and mother has seen the men, and they are
coming Monday morning, and it will all be done
beautifully before you get back, and you’ll never
know the old hut at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I felt a little hurt to hear her stigmatize, as the
old hut, what we had thought so pretty and nice
when we took possession of it ten years ago, but
had no time to protest before she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t mean to tell you, as I wished to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>how surprised you would be when you returned;
but I was afraid something might happen, the carpenters
get sick, or you come home sooner than you
intended, and so I had to tell you. See, here is the
plan. I had an architect come and make it the day
you were in New York. Isn’t it lovely, and such an
improvement?”</p>

<p class='c011'>I looked at the paper which she held toward me,
and saw on it a drawing which reminded me of one
of the boats of the White Star Line, it was so long
and narrow, with chimneys and smoke-stacks and
gables jutting out everywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you like it John?” Cilly asked, with a
most rueful face, and I replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, I dare say it is nice, but you see I
haven’t the least bit of building genius, and less
imagination, so I’ve no idea what it’s to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, John, what a stupid; that’s the new
piazza, and maybe the front door will have to be
moved, and that’s the new gable, and that’s the
conservatory, and here is our room right over the
kitchen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over the kitchen!” and I involuntarily sniffed
as I thought of onions, and codfish, and boiled cabbage,
each one of which was a favorite dish of mine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>though I did not like the smell in my sleeping
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cilly understood my meaning and hastened to
say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we have fixed all that; there’s to be deafening,
a double floor and a whole lot of mortar, and
we shall never hear a sound nor smell a smell, Jane
is so quiet; and it will be so pleasant with a broad
balcony and a door to go out. I wish you would
try to have a little interest in it, John.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So I tried to be interested, but could not forbear
asking her if she had the slightest conception of all
it involved, this raising the roof and Cain generally;
and then she cried, and the Lord part of her got the
ascendant, and she said I was <em>mean</em>, and an <em>old fogy</em>,
and a <em>conservative</em>, and a—well, she called me several
names, and then we made it up, and I told her to
fix away, and knock things endways if she wanted
to, and that’s about the way matters stood Monday
morning, when I said good-bye to her at half-past
six and hurried to the train. She was up to see me
off, the carpenters were coming at seven, and she
must be ready to receive them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t know the house when you get
home,” she said, “it will be so changed and improved;
and if you are at all puzzled to find it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>look for the very biggest and handsomest place on
the street. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was so elated with her repairing that I do
not think she was a bit sorry to have me go, and
this did not console me much, or make me take any
more kindly to the repairs. I did not hear from
her for three or four days, and then she was in high
spirits. Such nice men as the carpenters were, and
such fun to superintend them: she began to think
nature had intended her for a builder, or at least a
designer of houses.</p>

<p class='c011'>I groaned a little for fear my hitherto quiet,
satisfied Cilly should develop a propensity for
building, and ruin me entirely. It was in her family
on both sides, for old Mrs. Erastus Lord had ruined
her husband that way, while Mrs. Erastus, junior,
had sunk over twenty thousand dollars on a place
which originally cost five thousand, and which
when completed looked as if it had been taken up
and shaken by a high wind and thrown down promiscuously.
But I hoped better things of my little
Cilly, and resuming her letter, read that the piazza
was going up so fast, and they had not yet done a
single bit of damage, except to knock a hole through
one of the front door lights, and kill the ivy, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>was just growing so beautifully, and which had
come all the way from Kenilworth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next letter was not quite so hilarious and
assured, though Cilly was still hopeful and plucky,
notwithstanding that four windows had been broken,
and the arm of my Apollo Belvidere, which I had
bought in Florence, and a whole lot of plaster, had
fallen from the ceiling of the room where she was
sitting, and a man’s leg came right through, lathing
and all. I think the leg disturbed her more than
all the other mishaps, though her mother told her
it was nothing at all to what she must expect, but
she didn’t think it was nice, and it was such a muss
to have four carpenters, three masons, two tinners,
three painters, besides a boy to lath, and a man to
clean up, and the two thousand dollars would not
begin to pay for it all, and I must make some
arrangements, whereby she could get some more
money, and if I could she’d like me to stay away as
long as possible, not that she did not miss me
awfully, and the days seemed a month each, but she
did want the house done before I returned, and it
went on so slowly, though mother said they were
the best workmen she ever saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the substance of Cilly’s letter, and I did
not hear from her again except a few hurried lines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>saying she was well, and the house progressing, and
both drains stopped up, and a chimney blown
down, and the hard finish in one of the rooms
spoiled by the rain which beat in just as they got
the eaves-trough off. This was about as I had expected
it would be, but I was sorry for Cilly, and
sorry that my business kept me away from her six
weeks instead of four, as I had at first proposed.
But the day came at last for me to go home, and I
almost counted the minutes, until there came a whiz
and a crash, and we were off the track, with baggage
car smashed but nobody hurt. This made it very
late, midnight in fact, when we reached Morrisville,
and, valise in hand, I stepped out upon the platform.
It was the darkest night I think, I ever knew, and
the rain was falling in torrents. Fortunately, however,
there was a solitary cab in waiting, and I took
it and bade the negro drive me to No.— Guelph
street. But he was a stranger in the place, and
stared at me stupidly until I explained where
Guelph street was, and then remembering what
Cilly had said about looking for the handsomest
and largest house, bade him drive to the best and
most stylish house in the street, if he knew which
that was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sar, I done knows now,” and with a grin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>he banged the door, mounted his box and drove me
<em>somewhere</em>, and I alighted, paid my fare, and <em>heard</em>
him depart, for I could not see him, or the house
either, except with the eye of faith, but of course it
was mine, and I groped my way through the gate
and up to the front door, to which I tried to fit my
night-key, in vain, and after fumbling awhile at the
key hole, and trying a shutter to see if it was unfastened,
I was hunting for the bell knob, when suddenly
a window from above was opened; there was
a clicking sound, and then the sharp ring of a pistol
broke the midnight stillness. I was not hit, but a
good deal scared, and yelled out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Heaven’s sake, Cilly, what do you mean by
firing away at a chap like this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“John Logan, is that you? We thought it was
a burglar. What are you here for?” some one
called from the window, while at the same moment
the gas flashed up in the hall and showed me where
I was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not at my house at all, but at the large boarding
house at the upper end of the street, kept by a dashing
grass widow. Hastily explaining my mistake,
I said good night to Bob Sawyer, one of the
boarders, whose loud laugh discomfited me somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>as I felt my way into the street and started toward
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>This time I was sure I was right by the trees near
the gate, but the front door was gone—moved, and
not wishing to venture into unknown regions, I
concluded to try the bath-room door, for our rooms
were adjoining it, and I could easily speak to Cilly
without alarming her. So I tried it, and after
floundering over piles of rubbish, and tearing my
trousers on broads full of nails, and plunging up to
my knees in what seemed to be a muddy ditch, and
which smelled awfully, I suddenly found myself
plump in the cistern, with the water up to my chin;
at the same time I heard a succession of feminine
shrieks, conspicuous among which was Cilly’s voice,
crying out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we shall all be murdered. It is a burglar.
Throw something at him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And they <em>did</em> throw—first a soap dish, then the
poker, then the broom, and lastly a pair of my old
boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cilly, Cilly!” I screamed; “are you mad?
It’s I, John, drowning in the cistern.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then such a Babel as ensued; such a scrambling
down stairs, and opening of doors, and thrusting
out of tallow candles into the darkness. But I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>out of the cistern by this time, and, wet as a drowned
rat, confronted Cilly in her night-gown and crimping-pins,
and asked her “What the deuse was up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, John!” she sobbed; “everything is up;
the drain,” (that explained the smell), “the floor,
and the pump, and the walk, and I’ve had such a
dreadful time, and mother’s down with the rheumatism,
and Jane has sprained her ankle, and Mary has
gone, and I have got such a cold, and the town is
full of burglars, and I thought you were one, and I
wish we hadn’t repaired, it’s all so nasty and awful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day, which was Sunday, I had ample
time to survey the premises. There was a double
piazza on three sides, which was an improvement;
but the hall door was changed, which wasn’t. Then
the little conservatory, hitched on to the double bay
window, which looked like its father, was doubtful.
But all this was nothing to the confusion which
reigned at the back of the house; I only marveled
that I had not broken my neck. The walk was up,
the drain was up, the pump was up, the pipes were
up, the cistern floor was up, and the kitchen roof
was up, as well, looming into the sky, but the room
was far from being finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing had worked as she hoped it would,
Cilly said, and everything went wrong, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the eaves-troughs, and conductors, and pipes, and
it always rained just at the wrong time, and the
cellar filled with water, and everything floated like
a boat, and the plastering came down on the stove
when Jane was getting dinner, and the soot came
down from the chimney on Mary’s clean clothes,
and just as she got them all washed again and hung
out, they came with a lot of lumber and she had to
take them down, and things got so bad that she left
in disgust, and Jane had fallen into the drain and
sprained her ankle, and mother was sick in bed, and
the carpets all up, and, worse than all, the Dunnings
were coming next week from New York, and it was
more than Cilly could bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, I told her I’d help her bear it, and I
put my shoulder to the wheel and wrote to the
Dunnings to defer their visit, and began to investigate
matters, which I found had become a little
loose, to say the least of it. The men were good
enough and faithful enough, and the troubles Cilly
had encountered were only the troubles incident
upon repairing any old house, a job which is quite
as trying to one’s patience, and as exasperating as
putting up a stove pipe when no one joint fits
another, particularly the elbows, and the result is
that new pipe is almost always bought to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>place of the old. So with our house; nothing was
right, nothing would do again. No matter how
good or how long the piece of conductor, or lead
pipe, or bit of siding or floor, it would not fit, and it
went to swell the pile of rubbish which, in our back
yard was almost mountain high, and reminded me
of the excavations in Rome, when I first looked out
upon the debris that dreary Sunday morning. But
Monday showed a better state of things. I saw that
the open drain and cistern hurt Cilly the most, and
so I had them closed up first and then plunged into
the midst of the repairing, myself, and was astonished
to find how rapidly I began to develop a talent
for the business. I believe, after all, there is something
exhilarating in the smell of fresh plaster, and
something exciting in walking over piles of old
lath, and bits of broken siding, and base boards, and
moldings, and matched stuff, and so on through the
whole list of terms in a carpenter’s vocabulary. I
came to know them all, from <em>mitering</em> to <em>nosing</em>,
though I never rightly made out the orthography
of that last word or its derivation either, but I knew
just what it was, and was great on a squint to see if
things were square or <em>plumb</em>, as Billy called it, and
I think I made them change one window three
times, and a certain door twice. What a propensity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>they did have for getting things wrong, that is, according
to my ideas, and poor Cilly had been driven
nearly crazy with windows just where she did
not want them, and doors opening against her
furniture. Then, too, she informed me, she began
to suspect that the men thought she was strong-minded,
and wanted to vote, because she superintended
them, and was always in the thickest of it,
and exactly in their way. Whether they liked
masculine rule better, I never heard. I only know
that they all worked well and faithfully, and they
certainly did get on faster when they were not
obliged to pull down one day what they had done
the day before. This had been Cilly’s method of
procedure, aided and abetted by her mother, whom
the men stigmatized as “the old one,” and who spied
upon them from every keyhole, and came unexpectedly
upon them from every corner. She was
disabled now, and could only issue daily bulletins
to which I paid no heed, and so the repairs went on,
and just three months after the first nail was driven
the last man departed, and we went to work setting
to rights, which would have been delightful business,
if only we could have found our things, but
everything was lost or mislaid. Curtain fixtures
were gone; door keys were gone; stair rods were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>missing; screw drivers and tack-hammers could
not be found; wood-saw broken; both trowels
lost; water pails full of plaster, and all the brooms
in the house spoiled, to say nothing of the dusters
and dust pans broken, and dippers lost.</p>

<p class='c011'>But then, we had a double piazza, and a place
for flowers, and a china closet so big that I had to
spend a hundred dollars to fill it, and our bed-room
has two arches over the south windows, and a raised
platform behind them, and we have each of us a
bureau in a dressing-room which looks like a long
hall, and I have four drawers all to myself for my
shirts and neckties, and a quarter of a closet, and
there are east windows and south windows, which
make it so bright in the morning that the flies bite
me awfully, and we had to buy a mosquito net to
keep them off, and instead of being disturbed by
Mrs. Patterson’s pump, and looking into nothing
but her back yard and kitchen, we now look into
Mrs. Alling’s barn-yard, with a most unsightly
corn-crib in the center of it, and Mrs. Alling’s
roosters have a bad habit of crowing every hour,
while at about three or four o’clock in the morning,
the noise is so terrible, that I believe her hens crow
too.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Cilly likes that—it sounds rural and like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>the country; and our room is lovely, with the
two broad balconies where we sometimes have tea,
when the west wind is not too strong, the sun too
hot, or the mosquitoes too thick. Then it is such a
nice place to smoke, but Cilly never lets me do that
any more; she only smiles so sweetly on her gentlemen
friends, and tells them it’s a nice place, that I
am tempted to try it sometimes surreptitiously, when
she and her mother are down town at some of the
temperance meetings, but her mother would smell
me a mile off, and so I forbear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Honestly, though, I do enjoy the balconies,
and I rather like the arches over the windows, which
I call the <em>twins</em>, and which are very pretty. They
ought to be, for they cost enough. I’ve never told
Cilly just how much I paid, besides her brother’s
windfall, but when the greedy assessors tucked an
extra four thousand on our house because of the
<em>improvements</em>, I wondered how they guessed so accurately.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have five spare rooms now, but the new one
in the attic, which was built for Lizzie’s children
and the nurse, has never been occupied. The nurse
is afraid to sleep there, you have to pass through
such a menagerie of trunks, and broken chairs, and
rag bags, and old hoop skirts, and cast off pants, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>last year’s bonnets, to get to it, that it gives her the
horrors, and as the children will not sleep without
her, that room was made for nothing except to
show.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Erastus Lord, senior, is dead, and Cilly was
very sorry, when she died, and I suppose I was
sorry, too; and I <em>know</em> I was glad when Mrs.
Erastus, junior, recovered the use of her limbs, and
sailed away to Europe, where she finds the manners
and customs more congenial to her taste than here.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cilly and I live very quietly together now, and I
do not believe she has any thought of repairing
again, though she has told me in confidence that the
next time she does so, she means to stow the furniture
in the barn, and knock the plaster off from all
the old walls, which were so badly cracked when
the house was fixed the last time; but when she
actually gets to that point, as true as my name is
John Logan, I’ll lock her up in a lunatic asylum
and then commit suicide.</p>

We have seen the great Passion Play, and
the day is nearly over which we have
anticipated so long, and to which every
plan has been made subservient, since we
crossed the ocean. And now, while the streets are
full of people and the twilight shadows are falling
over Mt. Kofel, where the tall cross shows so conspicuously,
I sit down to write my impressions of
the wonderful drama, which, during the summer,
has attracted nearly 100,000 visitors to this little,
quiet, old-fashioned town, among the hills of
Bavaria. The high and the low, the rich and the
poor, the titled lord and the lowly peasant meet
here together, jostling side by side, sharing the same
fatigue and discomfort, and deeming neither too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>great a price to pay for the object they have in
view.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before speaking of the play in detail, it may not
be out of place to say something of the way to reach
Oberammergau, and of the town itself; and so, first,
the journey there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly all the Americans and English who visit
Oberammergau, make Munich their starting-point;
consequently the city is at this season crowded to
its utmost capacity, and reminds one of Philadelphia
during the Centennial. Naturally a great deal
of anxiety is felt by the tourist with regard to his
pilgrimage to the valley of the Ammer, especially
as he hears such exaggerated accounts of the difficulties
to be encountered on the way, and he is at
times half tempted to give it up as something unattainable.
When we reached Munich, on Friday,
August 20th, and made inquiries at our hotel as to
the probability of our getting tickets for August
29th, we were looked upon as lunatics for entertaining
such a thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was impossible under any circumstances to
procure a place for the 29th, we were told by the
clerk. There would be at least 6,000 people there,
with accommodations for 2,000, and our only way
was to wait quietly at the hotel until Sunday, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>29th; then take Gaze’s tickets, which were to be
had in the office for forty-five marks each, and go
to see the play on Monday, as it was sure to be
repeated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gaze, let me say, is an enterprising English
tourist agent, who has opened a hotel at Oberammergau,
and advertizes to board and lodge you for
two days and carry you to and from the railway
station at Murnau, where you leave the cars, for
forty-five marks, which are equal to $11.25 of American
money,—a pretty good price, it seemed to us, to
pay for two days’ board and a drive of sixteen
miles; but we accepted it as inevitable, and settled
down quietly to wait, until Providence threw in our
way an English clergyman, who changed our plans
entirely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t believe one word they tell you at the
hotels,” he said. “They wish to keep you here as
long as possible. Don’t listen to them. Don’t touch
a Gaze ticket. Don’t touch a Cook ticket. Don’t
touch anybody’s ticket, but just run your own canoe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On second considerations I am inclined to think
he did not use that last expression, which I believe
is purely American, but that was what he meant,
and he went on to say: “Write to the burgomaster
yourself and ask for the highest priced tickets.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>You’ll not get them, but you will get something.
Neither will he answer your letter, but your
name will be recorded and remembered when you
prefer your claim. Go on Friday by the early train
to Murnau, where you will find hundreds of
carriages waiting to take you to Oberammergau,
and once there, get a place for yourself at half the
sum charged by Gaze or his agents.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We followed the Englishman’s advice and wrote
to the burgomaster, and on Friday took the train
for Murnau, distant from Munich sixty miles, and
from Oberammergau sixteen. Here we expected
our troubles to commence, for we doubted a little
our English friend’s story of the carriages waiting
for us there; but he was right. There were hundreds
of them,—vehicles of every kind,—some good
enough for a princess, and some which looked as if
Eve herself might have driven in them, had driving
been one of her pastimes. I even noticed a cow and
a horse harnessed together, but I hardly think they
were there for the purpose of getting passengers.
At all events we did not take that establishment,
but chartering one, which had a pair of strong looking
horses, we were soon started on what proved to
be the pleasantest drive we ever experienced, and
one we shall never forget.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>There are two routes from Murnau to Oberammergau,—one
through the little village of Oberau
and up the famous Mt. Ettal, which is so steep and
long that passengers are obliged to walk up it, or
as a writer has expressed it, “Rich and poor have
to struggle with the steepness of Mt. Ettal for over
half an hour, while a pair of the best horses are
struggling hard to draw up an empty carriage.”
Marvelous stories are told of people who have had
the apoplexy, and of horses which have died toiling
up this hill, and as none of our party had a fancy to
try it, we chose the other, and to my mind the
pleasanter route of the two. It is a little longer
than the one through Ettal, but the road winds alternately
up and over hills neither too long or tiresome,
and down through grassy valleys fresh from
a recent shower and sweet with the perfume of new
mown hay, and into which little brooks came tumbling
from the mountains which shelter Oberammergau
and which are always in view. Long
before we reached the town I singled out one tall
peak which from its peculiar shape attracted my
curiosity and which I found to be the far-famed
Kofel, on which the cross is erected and which
bends over the little hamlet as if in benediction.
For this peak the people have a kind of superstitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>reverence, and when asked to repeat their
play in America, they replied, “We would do so
gladly, but we must bring our Kofel with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As we came down into the valley and passed
through Unterammergau our way lay through a
long avenue, bordered on either side with trees of
mountain ash, whose clusters of scarlet berries gave
a bit of coloring to the picture, and thus enhanced
its beauty. I wish I could convey to your minds a
correct idea of the loveliness of that valley, and
make you see it, as we saw it that summer afternoon,
when the sunlight fell so softly upon the
steep hillsides where the grass was green and
smooth as velvet, and little feathery wreaths of mist
were floating on the mountain tops, reminding one
of the patches of snow seen in midsummer in the
Alps of Switzerland. Through the valley the
Ammer runs swiftly, making sundry turns and
windings, as it goes singing on its way toward the
deep ravines, which lie beyond Unterammergau.
At the end of the ash-bordered avenue we crossed a
little bridge and were at last in Oberammergau.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not a pretty town, or a clean one either, notwithstanding
that a writer from whom I have before
quoted, says, that “it is the cleanest town in the
Bavarian Alps.” Not having seen all the towns in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>the Bavarian Alps, I am not prepared to dispute the
assertion, but if Oberammergau is the cleanest, what
must the others be? The streets are very narrow
and crooked, and wind here and there in a crazy
kind of manner very bewildering to the stranger,
who constantly loses his way. But there is never
any difficulty in finding it again, as the church, with
its peculiar dome, not unlike a Turkish mosque,
is a good landmark, as is also Gaze’s hotel, which
stands very nearly in the center of the town. This
last building looks as if it might have been an old
barn before it was converted to its present use. It
is very noisy around it, and dirty, too, in the
extreme. The streets do not look as if they were
ever picked up, and the open sewers are simply a
nuisance to the eye and an offense to the nostrils,
as are also the stables, of which there are quite as
many as houses. Every dwelling has its barn,
where the cows and horses are kept, and every barn
has its manure heap, piled and boarded with great
care, and standing close to the street, and oftentimes
under the very windows of the houses. The fleas
are everywhere, and attack you at all points, and
travel over you until you feel like tearing your hair
in utter desperation. And yet we have been told
by some that they have not seen a flea. Truly their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>lot was cast in a more fortunate locality than
ours.</p>

<p class='c011'>The houses of Oberammergau are for the most
part small, old-fashioned and peculiarly shaped, and
very few have flowers or trees in front. They stand
mostly in the street, as it were, and are neither
homelike nor inviting in their outward appearance.
Of course there are exceptions to this rule, and we
noticed several places where it would be a delight
to stay. But these had probably been engaged for
weeks, and when we drove to one of them which had
a pretty yard in front, we were received with a
shake of the head. At last, however, we found
rooms in a sort of <em>dependence</em> to a restaurant near
Gaze’s hotel, and though the stables were here, and
more smells than poor, abused Cologne ever boasted,
and though directly under our window there was a
beer garden, where I knew the peasantry would
probably spend most of the night, we concluded we
were fortunate to get even such quarters, and tried
to feel contented and cheerful, until in walking
about the town we came upon a tiny little cottage
standing in a patch of turnips, with the muck heap
behind the house instead of in front of it. There
were some boxes of flowers in the window, and the
face of the old lady who sat on a bench by the door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>was so pleasant and attractive that we accosted her,
and were told that “we could have the upper floor
if we liked,—would we step in and look?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were but four rooms in the whole house,
two below, the kitchen and the living room,—and
two above, but these were scrupulously clean, and
so odd-looking and delightful every way, that we
decided at once to take them. Now, men are supposed
to be more courageous than women, but the
head of our party proved the contrary in this
instance, and did not hesitate to say that alone and
unprotected he dared not face the woman with the
tumbled hair and dirty hands, who had smiled so
blandly when we took the rooms we were about to
give up. He must have help, he said, for though
the Oberammergauers have the reputation of being
very heavenly in their dispositions, he suspected
our late hostess might be an exception to the general
rule, and with her voluble French and German and
English, all utterly incomprehensible, prove more
than a match for him. So we went in a body, and
I, as the one most interested in the change, undertook
to explain to her very meekly that though her
rooms were excellent in their way, and she herself
everything to be desired in a landlady, I was afraid
the beer garden under my window might disturb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>me, and we had found rooms in a quieter part of
the town, where I should be more likely to sleep. I
might have spared myself the sweetness and
apologies, for they were lost upon her. With fierce
gestures and flashing eyes she poured out a torrent
of words, which, as nearly as I could judge, meant,
that of all the mean people it had been her fortune
to meet, we were the meanest and the worst; that
her beer garden was as still as the grave, and if I
could not sleep over it, the sooner I got out of her
house, the better; then, taking Mr. Holmes’s traveling
bag, she hurled it into the hall in a fashion
which made Walter turn pale, and showed that she
meant business. It was in vain that I tried to appease
her; I only made matters worse, as she grew
more furious and looked as if fully capable of taking
me up bodily and throwing me from the window
into her beer garden, the cause of the trouble. So
we hurried away with our bags and bundles and
were soon in possession of our new apartments, to
which we ascended by means of a step-ladder,
shutting the trap door behind us.</p>

<p class='c011'>What funny little rooms they were, with scarcely
space to turn round or stand upright! We had but
one sheet, and our covering was a feather bed,
while one towel served for the day. There were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>little bits of windows which opened like doors, and
our looking-glass was about a foot square. There
were madonnas and saints and crosses on the wall,
and presses which smelled of mint and musk, and
boxes and drawers, and curiosities of various kinds,
but the linen was white as snow, and the bare floor
was clean as soap and water could make it, as was
every part of the house, and with a deep feeling of
thankfulness for our good luck, we disposed of our
baggage as well as we could, and went out to see
the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day, Saturday, was the day for the
arrivals, and from early morning until night they
poured steadily in, until the town was full as it could
hold. Where all the people staid is a mystery. In
our little cottage the family slept in the woodshed,
while on the night preceding the play, some of their
friends slept on the floor of the living room. A
full description of the variety of accommodations
would fill a volume. Some of our friends reported
no sheet at all upon their beds; others slept on
pillows of hay, while others again boasted two
sheets and a lounge, with preserves and cake for
supper. It was very amusing to watch the new
arrivals and see the fastidious lady hold high her
silken skirts and glance ruefully at her dainty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>boots, as she was set down before a door which did
not look very inviting; to see, too, the Tyrolese
peasant woman, who had walked into town with
her basket of provisions on her arm, and with no
idea where she was to sleep. She had no anxiety
with regard to her wooden shoes, nor did she hold
up her cotton gown, for it was already above her
ankles and expanded by a hoop, such as was worn
years ago. Her home was far up among the Tyrol
mountains, and she had come miles to see the play;
but she was brisk as a bee, and after greeting her
acquaintances, whose costumes, like her own, were
of most wonderful fashion, she started with them
across the meadow and up the steep declivity,
in the direction of Mt. Kofel to say her prayers
before the monument.</p>

<p class='c011'>This is a marble group, representing a scene
from the crucifixion—Christ upon the cross, with
his mother and John standing on either side. It is
the gift of the present king, Ludwig of Bavaria, to
the Oberammergauers, in commemoration of the
play of 1870, which he witnessed. It is said to be
the work of Halbig, of Munich, and as a work of
art is very beautiful. As it is very large and stands
high, it attracts the attention at once, and hundreds
of the tourists climb the hill to examine it, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>most of the peasantry go there to pray before it,
kneeling, some upon the ground and some upon the
wooden benches placed there for that purpose.
The view from the monument is very fine, and of
itself repays one for the fatigue of the  ascent.
Leading from it to the village is a higher and dryer,
though longer road than the one across the meadow,
and this we took on our return, following it until
we reached the Church of Oberammergau.</p>

<p class='c011'>It stands very near the swiftly running Ammer,
in which some peasants were washing their clothes
when we crossed the bridge and entered the church
yard, where the curious crosses and headstones
which marked the graves of the dead made us linger
a while to examine them and read the names and
dates upon them. It would seem that almost a
third of the persons buried there were Langs. Indeed,
the Lang family is a very large one in Oberammergau.
The burgomaster is a Lang; St. John
is a Lang; Mary Magdalen is a Lang; Caiaphas is
a Lang, and several of the singers are also Langs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The church itself is not very large or pretentious
outwardly, and we were surprised to find so much
ornamentation inside. There was too much gilding,
it seemed to us, and the effect was rather tawdry
than otherwise. There were a few good pictures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>and under a glass case in an angle near the
altar is the skeleton of a woman, elaborately and
richly dressed, but looking ghastly and horrible to
those unaccustomed to such sights. The church is
chiefly interesting as being in one sense the training
school for the Passion Play. With its ceremonies,
its processions, its music and its singing, it prepares
the actors for the parts they take, and keeps the
scenes of the betrayal and crucifixion constantly in
their minds. Its pastor, the good and aged Daisenberger,
should be mentioned here as being closely
identified with the play as it now appears upon the
stage. He was the son of a peasant and is now
eighty-two years of age. His youth was spent in
the monastery of Ettal, with Othmar Weiss, who
revised the old Passion Play and adapted it to more
modern ideas. In 1845 Daisenberger became the
head of the church in Oberammergau and made
many changes in the play, striking out whatever he
thought objectionable or absurd, and materially elevating
its tone. He has also written several plays
of a more secular character, which are repeated during
the long winter months and constitute the only
amusement of the little town. At these dramatic
representations he directs and arranges in person,
and when he is gone, his place cannot well be filled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>The selection of the actors for the Passion Play
devolves upon a committee of forty-five householders,
with Daisenberger at their head, and the election
takes place the last week of the December previous
to the play. All the members attend divine
worship first, as they never do anything without a
prayer for guidance, and this it is which makes the
great drama seem so sacred and holy. To them it
is not to be lightly entered into, and the characters
are chosen from the best citizens, whose lives are
known to be perfectly upright and without reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Precisely at seven o’clock on the evening preceding
a play, the actors assemble at the extreme
end of the village, opposite the house of Tobias
Flunger, the Christus of 1850, and there form a
procession, which, headed by the band playing a
lively tune, marches through the principal streets to
the meadow near the theatre, where they disband
and return to their several homes. It has been said
that there is no rest in Oberammergau on the night
before a play, but we did not find it so. It was very
quiet around our cottage, and after ten o’clock
scarcely a sound was heard till morning, when at
five o’clock the booming of the cannon planted at
the foot of Mt. Kofel awoke the slumbering people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>and told them that the business of the day had commenced.
The first gun was followed by several
others in quick succession until everybody was
awake. The actors—and, including the musical
characters, there are nearly five hundred in all—hurried
to the church, where mass was performed,
as a preparation for what was to follow, while the
visitors hastened to get their breakfasts, so as to be
at the theatre when the doors opened.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are but few reserved seats, and as these
are taken weeks in advance, our tickets merely entitled
us to seats in a certain <em>platz</em>, or division, without
designating any particular spot.</p>

<p class='c011'>The theatre is plain and unpretending outwardly,
being built wholly of boards, with no
attempt at ornament of any kind. Inside it is also
very simple and has evidently never had much
money expended upon it. Its auditorium is 118
feet wide by 168 feet deep, and it occupies an area
of nearly 20,000 square feet, and is capable of seating
an audience of from 5,000 to 6,000 people.
There are visible to the spectator five distinct places
of action. First is the proscenium for choruses and
processions, and as this part of the stage is not
under cover, the singers are always exposed to the
weather, and stand, a part of the time, with the sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>shining directly in their faces. When it rains they
have no alternative but to bear it, and we were told
that they sometimes sang with umbrellas over their
heads.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second place is the central stage for the
<i><span lang="fr">tableaux vivants</span></i> and the usual dramatic scenes; the
third and fourth, which are reached by stairs, are
the palace of Annas and the palace of Pilate, while
the fifth represents the streets of Jerusalem.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus there is plenty of room, and never any
undue crowding, even when hundreds are on the
stage, as in some of the tableaux. In front of, and
facing the theatre proper, is the long area occupied
by the spectators and divided into compartments
varying in price from eight marks ($2) to one
mark (25 cents). The eight-mark seats are reserved,
and have backs, but all the others are simply
benches, with nothing to lean upon, and those
nearest the stage, in the one-mark places, have no
cover of any kind; consequently, when it rains or
the sun is very hot, those unfortunate enough to be
in that locality are neither comfortable nor happy,
especially as umbrellas are not allowed to be raised
on account of those behind, whose view would be
obstructed. And yet, in default of getting any
thing better, these places are eagerly sought after,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and some stand through the entire play rather than
not see it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The broad space overhead is left open for
the sake of the beautiful landscape, which adds
greatly to the effect. Casting your eye over and
beyond the stage, you see directly in front the
quiet valley, with the Ammer flowing through it;
to the right are steep hillsides clothed with grass,
and dotted here and there with trees of fir, while to
the left and farther back Mt. Kofel lifts his cross-crowned
head, and looks down upon the play. A
more lovely background could not be devised, and
when the eye was tired with the scenes upon the
stage it was such a rest to let it wander away to the
green fields beyond, even if it did detect a wicked
Oberammergauer fishing complacently in the river,
unmindful of the commandment respecting the
Sabbath day. Perhaps he thought he was quite as
well occupied as we, and others may think so, too,
but these have never seen the Passion Play, and do
not know how forcible is the lesson it teaches, or
how real it makes what before has seemed so misty
and vague to those who cannot easily grasp the
man Christ and make him seem human and life-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>By half-past seven the theatre was full of eager,
curious people, gathered from all parts of the world,
and from every station in life, from the nobility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>aristocratic England down to the lowly peasant of
the Tyrol. Even royalty is sometimes represented,
but the “blue box” set apart for it was vacant to-day,
for the Duke of Edinburgh, though expected, it was
rumored, did not come, and only Lord Houghton
and Lady Stanley and Lady George Gordon drew
the eyes of the curious in that direction. At last,
the booming of the cannon was heard again, and
then over the waiting thousands there fell a hush
of expectancy, while the orchestra played a sweet
and simple overture. Could we then have looked
behind the curtain which shut the stage from us, a
novel and touching sight, such as is not often seen
upon the boards of a theatre, would have met our
view. Five hundred people kneeling in silent
prayer and asking God’s blessing upon what they
were about to do. Again the booming of the
cannon was heard, followed quickly by the third
and last. It was eight o’clock; the curtain was
drawn, the chorus of singers appeared upon the
stage, and the “Passion Play” we had come so far
to see, had commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>As most of our readers know, the Passion Play
is performed in fulfillment of a vow made by the
people in 1633, when a fearful pestilence was ravaging
the villages in the valley. For a long time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>Oberammergau was free from the plague, owing to
the strictness of the sanitary precautions; but it
was brought to them at last by a laborer, who had
been working in an infected district, and who succeeded
in entering the town to see his wife and
children. In a day or two he was dead, and so
rapidly did the disease spread, that in thirty-three
days eighty-four persons belonging to the village
died. Then it was that the terrified inhabitants met
together and made a solemn vow that if God would
remove the dreadful scourge they would perform
the Passion Play every ten years. From that time
there were no more deaths in Oberammergau, and
the play was acted the following year, 1634. The
decaded period, however, was not chosen until 1680,
and since that time the play has been performed
every ten years, with more or less interruptions.
It must, however, have been known to the peasantry
of Bavaria before 1633, as history speaks of it at
a much earlier period. Since 1634 it has undergone
many changes and modifications and been stripped
of much that was absurd and offensive. Once the
devil was a constant actor upon the stage, and used
to dance around Judas during the temptation, and
when at last the betrayer hanged himself, a host of
demons rushed upon him, as if to bear him away to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>endless torment. Later, too, the spectators were
wont to groan and hiss when he appeared, and even
pelt him with dirt and stones, so that it was difficult
to find a man with sufficient nerve to take the part
of <em>Judas</em>. Now, however, this is changed, and the
good taste of the Geistlicher-Rath Daisenberger, is
perceptible in every part of the play. In 1870 the
play was broken up by the Franco-German war.
Forty of the Ammergauers were called into the Bavarian
army, and among them Joseph Maier, the
<i><span lang="la">Christus</span></i> of that year. When the news of peace
reached the valley, fires were lighted on every
mountain top from the Adenwald to the Tyrol, and
the villagers resolved to give a repetition of the
play by way of thanksgiving. It was a great success,
and thousands of tourists went to witness it,
all of whom were loud in their praises of Joseph
Maier, whose acting cannot be excelled, and who,
after the burgomaster, is looked up to by the peasantry
as a man second only in importance to the
good Daisenberger himself. But of him I shall
speak more particularly by and bye. I wish now
to describe the opening scene, which heralded the
beginning of the play.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chorus of Schutzgeister, or Guardian Angels,
as they are called, is a peculiar feature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the Ammergau stage and adds greatly to the interest.
The chorus consists of twenty-six singers, and
the leader is styled the Prologue, or <i><span lang="la">choragus</span></i>. Immediately
after the third and last cannon they
appear, thirteen on a side, and march slowly and
solemnly into line. Their dresses are of various
colors, and over them a white tunic or colored
mantle is worn, giving them a picturesque and
oriental appearance. Among them are several
young women, some of whose faces are very pretty
and sweet, and they seem to feel that it is a religious
duty rather than a pleasure to stand thus before
the five thousand pairs of eyes gazing so fixedly
at them. Each act of the play is preceded by one
or two <em>tableaux vivants</em>, as symbols or prophecies of
scenes in the life of Christ, and it is the part of the
<em>choragus</em>, or chief singer, to describe these tableaux
and the lesson they are intended to teach. This he
does in song, his companions taking up the chorus
at intervals, and making the whole very impressive
and interesting, especially as some of the solos are
finely rendered, in voices clear and sweet, if not
highly cultivated. The song or recitation ended,
the <em>choragus</em> steps backwards and with half the
singers marches to the left of the stage, while the
other half retire to the right, where they stand motionless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>as statues, while the curtain is withdrawn
from the inner stage, and the tableau is exposed to
view for two or three minutes, while, watch as closely
as you may, you cannot detect the slightest movement
in the mass of humanity so artistically
grouped together.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first tableau represented Adam and Eve being
driven from the Paradise, which lay in the background,
while, conspicuous in the center of the garden,
was the tree of life, laden with fruit, and among
its branches, the tempter, in the form of a serpent,
was coiled. The second tableau, which follows immediately
after the close of the chorus, revealed a large
cross planted on a rock, with crowds of children
dressed in white kneeling around it in a worshiping
attitude. The prayers the children are supposed to
be saying, are sung by the chorus, who retire from
the stage, and the first act of the great drama commences.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shouts of rejoicing and notes of glad singing
were faintly heard, seeming at first so far away that
one could easily believe they came from the green
hilltops, seen over and beyond the theatre; nearer
and nearer they came, until the long procession appeared
in view, and the shouts and singing grew
louder, as the thronging crowds, carrying palms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>their hands, welcomed to Jerusalem their master.
Then it is that you see <em>Joseph Maier</em>—the central
figure of the play—the one on whom every eye is
fixed whenever he appears, and the sight of whom
makes your heart throb faster as you remember that
the scenes you look upon were once a reality, when
Jerusalem opened wide her gates, and her streets
resounded with the loud hosannas of the multitude
doing honor to the man riding in their midst. A
better <i><span lang="la">Christus</span></i> than Joseph Maier could not have
been selected. Tall, finely formed, with a sad, pale
face, and long, flowing hair, he impresses you at
once, and your first thought is what a splendid looking
man, and how well fitted for his part—a conviction
which deepens as the play progresses, and you
watch him in all the varied situations he has to fill.
Not a trace of self-consciousness is ever perceptible
in his manner, which is always dignified and self-possessed,
like one who feels himself the master.
His voice is clear, and full, and rich, and you find
yourself constantly listening for it, especially toward
the last, when the musical tones are full of
anguish or tender expostulation and disappointment,
as he says to his sleeping disciples: “Could
ye not watch with me one hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As a general thing, he was well sustained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Judas was inimitable, and considering the character
he had to take, may almost be said to be better than
Joseph Maier himself. With the latter every heart
was in sympathy, while for Judas there naturally
could be but one feeling, and that of indignation, but
so powerfully was he tempted by the artful Pharisees,
and so hard and long did he struggle against the
temptation, and so bitter was his repentance when
the deed was done, that you have only a deep sympathy
for him as he stands alone by himself and
gives vent to his remorse. I can see him now so
plainly as he walked the stage, wringing his hands
in his despair, and catching at his long gray hair as
he lamented his folly, and with bitter cries mourned
for the dear friend he had betrayed. You do not
see him hang himself, but you see him make a rush
at the mountain ash, placed there for that purpose,
and which hardly looks as if it would sustain him.
But the curtain falls in time to shut out any inconsistencies,
and poor Judas “goes to his own place,”
and is seen no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next to <em>Judas</em> in point of acting comes rash,
impetuous and cowardly <em>Peter</em>, who, even if you did
not know the story, would impress you as a loving,
true hearted man, sure to weep bitterly over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>denial called forth by fear, and to be among the
first to seek the tomb of the risen Saviour.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>John</em>, the beloved, was a little too tame and quiet
for the part he took, while <em>Magdalen</em> was an utter
failure. One great feature of the play was the perfect
self-forgetfulness of the actors, but this did not
apply to <em>Magdalen</em>, whose self-consciousness was so
apparent and whose voice was so unnatural and
peculiar that we were sorry when she appeared and
glad when she left the stage. Her personal appearance
was quite contrary to one’s idea of the
<em>Magdalen</em>, to whom the old masters always gave
long, flowing hair of a reddish or golden hue, for
hers was dark and so short and thin that to wipe
one’s feet with it was an utter absurdity. She might,
of course, have called in art to her assistance, and
worn hair of wondrous length and thickness, but
such deceptions are unknown to the Magdalen of
Oberammergau, whose locks were all her own, as
were the few attractions she possessed. The
Madonna, on the contrary, was excellent, with a
fair, sweet face, which would lead us to question the
propriety of selecting so young a person for the
mother of Christ, if we did not know that the
Bavarian peasantry believe in the perpetual youth
and beauty of the Virgin Mary. The parting scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>between the mother and her son before he goes up
to Jerusalem is very touching and sad, for Mary’s
heart is wrung with dismal forebodings of some
evil which will befall her child, and her voice is full
of pathos and entreaty, while with infinite love and
tenderness he bends over her trying to reassure and
comfort her. This is the third act, and after the
supper in Simon’s house, where Mary anointed the
Saviour’s head, and Judas was filled with horror at
the useless expenditure of the three hundred
pence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second act, of which I omitted to speak,
represented the high priests in session, and consulting
together how to secure the person of Christ.
Conspicuous among these was <em>Caiaphas</em>, who was
admirably represented by one of the Langs, and
who never for an instant forgot the part he was
acting, or ceased to be other than the proud and
despotic man thirsting for the blood of the lowly
Nazarene.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fourth act we had the temptation of Judas,
and in the fifth the institution of the Lord’s Supper,
when Christ washed his disciples’ feet, and foretold
that one of them should betray him. Next we saw
the Garden of Gethsemane, over which the shadows
of night hung darkly, and where the Saviour, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>great agony, prayed for the cup to pass from him,
if possible; while, a little apart, his disciples were
sleeping heavily. In the distance and gradually
approaching nearer, the sound of loud, excited
voices and hurried footsteps was heard, as the Roman
soldiers, with the Pharisees and chief priests,
approached, led by Judas, who even then seemed to
hesitate before giving the kiss of betrayal. The
text of the history is here followed very closely, and
ends with the captivity of the Saviour, who is borne
away by the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time it was nearly twelve, and an intermission
of an hour was given, in which the spectators
hurried to their lunch and were again in their
places by the time the cannon in the meadows announced
that the drama was about to be resumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>As in the morning we followed the Saviour from
his entry into Jerusalem up to his betrayal, so in the
afternoon we followed him to his crucifixion and
death, and saw him first before Annas, then before
Caiaphas, and then before Pilate, who strove so
hard to save him, and who, hoping to awaken the
sympathy of the people for the man whose life they
sought, ordered Barabbas to be brought forth and
placed side by side with the noble captive. Where
they picked up Barabbas is a marvel. With long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>grey hair, which looked as if it never had been
combed, and a face from which you instinctively
recoiled, he was led upon the stage by a halter or
chain,—a marked contrast to the calm, quiet dignity
of Joseph Maier, who, bound and bleeding from his
recent scourging and the crown of thorns, stood
beside him before the rabble thirsting for his blood
and crying out, “Give us the Nazarene and let
Barabbas go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Matters now are hurried on with great rapidity,
and as the end comes nearer and nearer, the hush
which all along has pervaded that vast concourse
grows more and more profound, and the tension to
which the peoples’ nerves are strung reaches its
climax, when in the fifteenth act you see the long
procession winding its way up to Calvary, with the
white-faced, worn-out Saviour tottering under the
weight of his heavy cross, while the brutal soldiery
urge him to greater speed, and the infuriated mob
rend the air with their shouts of hatred and derision.
Then the tears which have so long been kept back
overflow, and the heart throbs with a keen sense of
love and pity and sympathy, not for <em>Joseph Maier</em>,
but for the man Christ, to whom this, which now is
only acting, was once a terrible reality, and who
really trod the weary road to Calvary, and bore not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>only the ponderous cross but the sins of the whole
world. Every one was more or less affected, and
the silence of the audience was almost painful in its
intensity, though broken occasionally by a suppressed
whisper or low cry, as the crowd increased
and the boisterous shouts grew louder and the mob
hurried the Saviour on, until from sheer exhaustion
he fell upon the ground, and the cross was finally
laid upon the shoulders of Simon of Cyrene, who
conveniently appeared with a carpenter’s basket on
his arm. This ascent to Calvary is, I think, more
effective and affecting than the crucifixion, which
is, however, a most marvelous piece of acting, and
seems terribly real as you gaze at the central figure
upon the cross, and fancy you see the death struggle
from the beginning, until the white, worn face
drops downward, and you are glad with a great
gladness that all is over.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thenceforward there is more stir among the
people, and the tired ones, who have sat so long,
unmindful of fatigue, change their positions and
breathe more freely as they wait for the scene of
the resurrection. This, some critics say, might be
omitted—that the play is long enough without it;
but I hardly agree with them, for what would the
crucifixion avail without the rising from the dead?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>And when at last the rock is rolled away and Jesus
is alive again and speaks to the loving Mary, you
experience something of the same thrill you feel on
Easter morning, and your thoughts go back to the
dear home church across the sea, where you have
so often heard the Easter bells and joined in the
Easter songs. Loudly and joyfully the singers take
up the chorus, “He is risen, He is risen,” and if
your tongue were tuned to their language you
would almost join them in their exultant strains.
But a tableau representing the ascension is to
follow, and you sit quietly till that is over; then,
singing the final hallelujah chorus, the Schutzgeister
slowly retire from the stage and the play is
over, and we leave the theatre with a feeling that
we have witnessed something which for all time to
come, will, like some earnest, heart-stirring sermon,
repeat itself over and over again in our minds, until
we are made better by it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
